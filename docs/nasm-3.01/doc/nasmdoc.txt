                       NASM - The Netwide Assembler
                       ============================

Chapter 1: Introduction
-----------------------

   1.1 What Is NASM?

       The Netwide Assembler, NASM, is an 80x86 and x86-64 assembler
       designed for portability and modularity. It supports a range of
       object file formats, including Linux and BSD `a.out', ELF, Mach-O,
       16-bit and 32-bit `.obj' (OMF) format, COFF (including its Win32 and
       Win64 variants.) It can also output plain binary files, Intel hex
       and Motorola S-Record formats. Its syntax is designed to be simple
       and easy to understand, similar to the syntax in the Intel Software
       Developer Manual with minimal complexity. It supports all currently
       known x86 architectural extensions, and has strong support for
       macros.

Chapter 2: Running NASM
-----------------------

   2.1 NASM Command-Line Syntax

       To assemble a file, you issue a command of the form

       nasm -f <format> <filename> [-o <output>]

       For example,

       nasm -f elf myfile.asm

       will assemble `myfile.asm' into an 32-bit ELF object file
       `myfile.o'. And

       nasm -f bin myfile.asm -o myfile.com

       will assemble `myfile.asm' into a raw binary file `myfile.com'.

       To produce a listing file, with the hex codes output from NASM
       displayed on the left of the original sources, use the `-l' option
       to give a listing file name, for example:

       nasm -f coff myfile.asm -l myfile.lst

       To get further usage instructions from NASM, try typing

       nasm -h

       The option `--help' is an alias for the `-h' option.

       Like Unix compilers and assemblers, NASM is silent unless it goes
       wrong: you won't see any output at all, unless it gives error
       messages.

 2.1.1 The `-o' Option: Output File Name

       NASM will normally choose the name of your output file for you;
       precisely how it does this is dependent on the object file format.
       For Microsoft object file formats (`obj', `win32' and `win64'), it
       will remove the `.asm' extension (or whatever extension you like to
       use - NASM doesn't care) from your source file name and substitute
       `.obj'. For Unix object file formats (`aout', `as86', `coff',
       `elf32', `elf64', `elfx32', `ieee', `macho32' and `macho64') it will
       substitute `.o'. For `dbg', `ith' and `srec', it will use `.dbg',
       `.ith' and `.srec', respectively, and for the `bin' format it will
       simply remove the extension, so that `myfile.asm' produces the
       output file `myfile'.

       If the output file already exists, NASM will overwrite it, unless it
       has the same name as the input file, in which case it will give a
       warning and use `nasm.out' as the output file name instead.

       For situations in which this behaviour is unacceptable, NASM
       provides the `-o' command-line option, which allows you to specify
       your desired output file name. You invoke `-o' by following it with
       the name you wish for the output file, either with or without an
       intervening space. For example:

       nasm -f bin program.asm -o program.com 
       nasm -f bin driver.asm -odriver.sys

       Note that this is a small o, and is different from a capital O ,
       which is used to specify the number of optimization passes required.
       See section 2.1.24.

 2.1.2 The `-f' Option: Output File Format

       If you do not supply the `-f' option to NASM, it will choose an
       output file format for you itself. In the distribution versions of
       NASM, the default is always `bin'; if you've compiled your own copy
       of NASM, you can redefine `OF_DEFAULT' at compile time and choose
       what you want the default to be.

       Like `-o', the intervening space between `-f' and the output file
       format is optional; so `-f elf' and `-felf' are both valid.

       A complete list of the available output file formats can be given by
       issuing the command `nasm -h'.

 2.1.3 The `-l' Option: Generating a Listing File

       If you supply the `-l' option to NASM, followed (with the usual
       optional space) by a file name, NASM will generate a source-listing
       file for you, in which addresses and generated code are listed on
       the left, and the actual source code, with expansions of multi-line
       macros (except those which specifically request no expansion in
       source listings: see section 5.5.11) on the right. For example:

       nasm -f elf myfile.asm -l myfile.lst

       If a list file is selected, you may turn off listing for a section
       of your source with `[list -]', and turn it back on with `[list +]',
       (the default, obviously). There is no "user form" (without the
       brackets). This can be used to list only sections of interest,
       avoiding excessively long listings.

 2.1.4 The `-L' Option: Additional or Modified Listing Info

       Use this option to specify listing output details.

       Supported options are:

       (*) `-Lb' show builtin macro packages (standard and `%use')

       (*) `-Ld' show byte and repeat counts in decimal, not hex

       (*) `-Le' show the preprocessed input

       (*) `-Lf' ignore `.nolist' and force listing output

       (*) `-LF' ignore `[LIST]' directives (see section 8.15)

       (*) `-Lm' show multi-line macro calls with expanded parameters

       (*) `-Lp' output a list file in every pass, in case of errors

       (*) `-Ls' show all single-line macro definitions

       (*) `-Lw' flush the output after every line (very slow, mainly
           useful to debug NASM crashes)

       (*) `-L+' enable _all_ listing options except `-Lw' (very verbose)

       These options can be enabled or disabled at runtime using the
       `%pragma list options' directive:

       %pragma list options [+|-]flags...

       For example, to turn on the `d' and `m' flags but disable the `s'
       flag:

       %pragma list options +dm -s

       For forward compatility reasons, an undefined flag will be ignored.
       Thus, a new flag introduced in a newer version of NASM can be
       specified without breaking older versions. Listing flags will always
       be a single alphanumeric character and are case sensitive.

 2.1.5 The `-M' Option: Generate Makefile Dependencies

       This option can be used to generate makefile dependencies on stdout.
       This can be redirected to a file for further processing. For
       example:

       nasm -M myfile.asm > myfile.dep

 2.1.6 The `-MG' Option: Generate Makefile Dependencies

       This option can be used to generate makefile dependencies on stdout.
       This differs from the `-M' option in that if a nonexisting file is
       encountered, it is assumed to be a generated file and is added to
       the dependency list without a prefix.

 2.1.7 The `-MF' Option: Set Makefile Dependency File

       This option can be used with the `-M' or `-MG' options to send the
       output to a file, rather than to stdout. For example:

       nasm -M -MF myfile.dep myfile.asm

 2.1.8 The `-MD' Option: Assemble and Generate Dependencies

       The `-MD' option acts as the combination of the `-M' and `-MF'
       options (i.e. a filename has to be specified.) However, unlike the
       `-M' or `-MG' options, `-MD' does _not_ inhibit the normal operation
       of the assembler. Use this to automatically generate updated
       dependencies with every assembly session. For example:

       nasm -f elf -o myfile.o -MD myfile.dep myfile.asm

       If the argument after `-MD' is an option rather than a filename,
       then the output filename is the first applicable one of:

       (*) the filename set in the `-MF' option;

       (*) the output filename from the `-o' option with `.d' appended;

       (*) the input filename with the extension set to `.d'.

 2.1.9 The `-MT' Option: Dependency Target Name

       The `-MT' option can be used to override the default name of the
       dependency target. This is normally the same as the output filename,
       specified by the `-o' option.

2.1.10 The `-MQ' Option: Dependency Target Name (Quoted)

       The `-MQ' option acts as the `-MT' option, except it tries to quote
       characters that have special meaning in Makefile syntax. This is not
       foolproof, as not all characters with special meaning are quotable
       in `make'. The default output (if no `-MT' or `-MQ' option is
       specified) is automatically quoted.

2.1.11 The `-MP' Option: Emit Phony Makefile Targets

       When used with any of the dependency generation options, the `-MP'
       option causes NASM to emit a phony target without dependencies for
       each header file. This prevents `make' from complaining if a header
       file has been removed.

2.1.12 The `-MW' Option: Watcom `make' quoting style

       This option causes NASM to attempt to quote dependencies according
       to Watcom `make' conventions rather than POSIX `make' conventions
       (also used by most other `make' variants.) This quotes `#' as `$#'
       rather than `\#', uses `&' rather than `\' for continuation lines,
       and encloses filenames containing whitespace in double quotes.

2.1.13 The `-F' Option: Debug Information Format

       This option is used to select the format of the debug information
       emitted into the output file, to be used by a debugger (or _will_
       be). Prior to version 2.03.01, the use of this switch did _not_
       enable output of the selected debug info format. Use `-g', see
       section 2.1.14, to enable output. Versions 2.03.01 and later
       automatically enable `-g' if `-F' is specified.

       A complete list of the available debug file formats for an output
       format can be seen by issuing the command `nasm -h'. Not all output
       formats currently support debugging output.

       This should not be confused with the `-f dbg' output format option,
       see section 9.14.

2.1.14 The `-g' Option: Enabling Debug Information.

       This option can be used to generate debugging information in the
       specified format. See section 2.1.13. Using `-g' without `-F'
       results in emitting debug info in the default format, if any, for
       the selected output format. If no debug information is currently
       implemented in the selected output format, `-g' is _silently
       ignored_.

2.1.15 The `-X' Option: Selecting an Error Reporting Format

       This option can be used to select an error reporting format for any
       error messages that might be produced by NASM.

       Currently, two error reporting formats may be selected. They are the
       `-Xvc' option and the `-Xgnu' option. The GNU format is the default
       and looks like this:

       filename.asm:65: error: specific error message

       where `filename.asm' is the name of the source file in which the
       error was detected, `65' is the source file line number on which the
       error was detected, `error' is the severity of the error (this could
       be `warning'), and `specific error message' is a more detailed text
       message which should help pinpoint the exact problem.

       The other format, specified by `-Xvc' is the style used by Microsoft
       Visual C++ and some other programs. It looks like this:

       filename.asm(65) : error: specific error message

       where the only difference is that the line number is in parentheses
       instead of being delimited by colons.

       See also the `Visual C++' output format, section 9.6.

2.1.16 The `-Z' Option: Send Errors to a File

       Under MS-DOS it can be difficult (though there are ways) to redirect
       the standard-error output of a program to a file. Since NASM usually
       produces its warning and error messages on `stderr', this can make
       it hard to capture the errors if (for example) you want to load them
       into an editor.

       NASM therefore provides the `-Z' option, taking a filename argument
       which causes errors to be sent to the specified files rather than
       standard error. Therefore you can redirect the errors into a file by
       typing

       nasm -Z myfile.err -f obj myfile.asm

       In earlier versions of NASM, this option was called `-E', but it was
       changed since `-E' is an option conventionally used for
       preprocessing only, with disastrous results. See section 2.1.22.

2.1.17 The `-s' Option: Send Errors to `stdout'

       The `-s' option redirects error messages to `stdout' rather than
       `stderr', so it can be redirected under MS-DOS. To assemble the file
       `myfile.asm' and pipe its output to the `more' program, you can
       type:

       nasm -s -f obj myfile.asm | more

       See also the `-Z' option, section 2.1.16.

2.1.18 The `-i' Option: Include File Search Directories

       When NASM sees the `%include' or `%pathsearch' directive in a source
       file (see section 5.8.1, section 5.8.2 or section 3.2.3), it will
       search for the given file not only in the current directory, but
       also in any directories specified on the command line by the use of
       the `-i' option. Therefore you can include files from a macro
       library, for example, by typing

       nasm -ic:\macrolib\ -f obj myfile.asm

       (As usual, a space between `-i' and the path name is allowed, and
       optional).

       Prior NASM 2.14 a path provided in the option has been considered as
       a verbatim copy and providing a path separator been up to a caller.
       One could implicitly concatenate a search path together with a
       filename. Still this was rather a trick than something useful. Now
       the trailing path separator is made to always present, thus `-ifoo'
       will be considered as the `-ifoo/' directory.

       If you want to define a _standard_ include search path, similar to
       `/usr/include' on Unix systems, you should place one or more `-i'
       directives in the `NASMENV' environment variable (see section
       2.1.36).

       For Makefile compatibility with many C compilers, this option can
       also be specified as `-I'.

2.1.19 The `-p' Option: Pre-Include a File

       NASM allows you to specify files to be _pre-included_ into your
       source file, by the use of the `-p' option. So running

       nasm myfile.asm -p myinc.inc

       is equivalent to running `nasm myfile.asm' and placing the directive
       `%include "myinc.inc"' at the start of the file.

       `--include' option is also accepted.

       For consistency with the `-I', `-D' and `-U' options, this option
       can also be specified as `-P'.

2.1.20 The `-d' Option: Pre-Define a Macro

       Just as the `-p' option gives an alternative to placing `%include'
       directives at the start of a source file, the `-d' option gives an
       alternative to placing a `%define' directive. You could code

       nasm myfile.asm -dFOO=100

       as an alternative to placing the directive

       %define FOO 100

       at the start of the file. You can miss off the macro value, as well:
       the option `-dFOO' is equivalent to coding `%define FOO'. This form
       of the directive may be useful for selecting assembly-time options
       which are then tested using `%ifdef', for example `-dDEBUG'.

       For Makefile compatibility with many C compilers, this option can
       also be specified as `-D'.

2.1.21 The `-u' Option: Undefine a Macro

       The `-u' option undefines a macro that would otherwise have been
       pre-defined, either automatically or by a `-p' or `-d' option
       specified earlier on the command lines.

       For example, the following command line:

       nasm myfile.asm -dFOO=100 -uFOO

       would result in `FOO' _not_ being a predefined macro in the program.
       This is useful to override options specified at a different point in
       a Makefile.

       For Makefile compatibility with many C compilers, this option can
       also be specified as `-U'.

2.1.22 The `-E' Option: Preprocess Only

       NASM allows the preprocessor to be run on its own, up to a point.
       Using the `-E' option (which requires no arguments) will cause NASM
       to preprocess its input file, expand all the macro references,
       remove all the comments and preprocessor directives, and print the
       resulting file on standard output (or save it to a file, if the `-o'
       option is also used).

       This option cannot be applied to programs which require the
       preprocessor to evaluate expressions which depend on the values of
       symbols: so code such as

       %assign tablesize ($-tablestart)

       will cause an error in preprocess-only mode.

       For compatibility with older version of NASM, this option can also
       be written `-e'. `-E' in older versions of NASM was the equivalent
       of the current `-Z' option, section 2.1.16.

2.1.23 The `-a' Option: Suppress Preprocessing

       If NASM is being used as the back end to a compiler, it might be
       desirable to suppress preprocessing completely and assume the
       compiler has already done it, to save time and increase compilation
       speeds. The `-a' option, requiring no argument, instructs NASM to
       replace its powerful preprocessor with a stub preprocessor which
       does nothing.

2.1.24 The `-O' Option: Multipass Optimization

       Using the `-O' option, you can tell NASM to carry out different
       levels of optimization. Multiple flags can be specified after the
       `-O' options, some of which can be combined in a single option, e.g.
       `-Oxv'.

       (*) `-O0': No optimization. All operands take their long forms, if a
           short form is not specified, except conditional jumps. This is
           intended to match NASM 0.98 behavior.

       (*) `-O1': Minimal optimization. As above, but immediate operands
           which will fit in a signed byte are optimized, unless the long
           form is specified. Conditional jumps default to the long form
           unless otherwise specified.

       (*) `-Ox' (where `x' is the actual letter `x'): Multipass
           optimization. Minimize branch offsets and signed immediate
           bytes, overriding size specification unless the `strict' keyword
           has been used (see section 3.7). For compatibility with earlier
           releases, the letter `x' may also be any number greater than
           one. This number has no effect on the actual number of passes.

       (*) `-Ov': At the end of assembly, print the number of passes
           actually executed.

       The `-Ox' mode is recommended for most uses, and is the default
       since NASM 2.09. _Any other mode will generate worse quality
       output._ Use `-O0' or `-O1' only if you need the finer programmer-
       level control of output and `strict' is not suitable for your use
       case.

       Note that this is a capital `O', and is different from a small `o',
       which is used to specify the output file name. See section 2.1.1.

2.1.25 The `-t' Option: TASM Compatibility Mode

       NASM includes a limited form of compatibility with Borland's TASM.
       When NASM's `-t' option is used, the following changes are made:

       (*) local labels may be prefixed with `@@' instead of `.'

       (*) size override is supported within brackets. In TASM compatible
           mode, a size override inside square brackets changes the size of
           the operand, and not the address type of the operand as it does
           in NASM syntax. E.g. `mov eax,[DWORD val]' is valid syntax in
           TASM compatibility mode. Note that you lose the ability to
           override the default address type for the instruction.

       (*) unprefixed forms of some directives supported (`arg', `elif',
           `else', `endif', `if', `ifdef', `ifdifi', `ifndef', `include',
           `local')

2.1.26 The `-w' and `-W' Options: Enable or Disable Assembly Warnings

       NASM can observe many conditions during the course of assembly which
       are worth mentioning to the user, but not a sufficiently severe
       error to justify NASM refusing to generate an output file. These
       conditions are reported like errors, but come up with the word
       `warning' before the message. Warnings do not prevent NASM from
       generating an output file and returning a success status to the
       operating system.

       Some conditions are even less severe than that: they are only
       sometimes worth mentioning to the user. Therefore NASM supports the
       `-w' command-line option, which enables or disables certain classes
       of assembly warning. Such warning classes are described by a name,
       for example `label-orphan'; you can enable warnings of this class by
       the command-line option `-w+label-orphan' and disable it by
       `-w-label-orphan'.

       Since version 2.15, NASM has group aliases for all prefixed
       warnings, so they can be used to enable or disable all warnings in
       the group. For example, -w+float enables all warnings with names
       starting with float-*.

       Since version 2.00, NASM has also supported the `gcc'-like syntax
       `-Wwarning-class' and `-Wno-warning-class' instead of
       `-w+warning-class' and `-w-warning-class', respectively; both
       syntaxes work identically.

       The option `-w+error' or `-Werror' can be used to treat warnings as
       errors. This can be controlled on a per warning class basis
       (`-w+error='_warning-class_ or `-Werror='_warning-class_); if no
       _warning-class_ is specified NASM treats it as `-w+error=all'; the
       same applies to `-w-error' or `-Wno-error', of course.

       In addition, you can control warnings in the source code itself,
       using the `[WARNING]' directive. See section 8.14.

       See appendix A for the complete list of warning classes.

2.1.27 The `-v' Option: Display Version Info

       Typing `NASM -v' will display the version of NASM which you are
       using, and the date on which it was compiled.

       You will need the version number if you report a bug.

       For command-line compatibility with Yasm, the form `--v' is also
       accepted for this option starting in NASM version 2.11.05.

2.1.28 The `--[gl]prefix' and `--[gl]postfix' Options

       The `--gprefix' option prepends the given argument to all `extern',
       `common', `static', and `global' symbols, and the `--lprefix' option
       prepends to all other symbols. Similarly, `--gpostfix' and
       `--lpostfix' options append the argument, in a manner similar to the
       `--[gl]prefix' options.

       Running this:

       nasm -f macho --gprefix _

       is equivalent to placing the directive `%pragma macho gprefix _' at
       the start of the file (section 8.10). It will prepend the underscore
       to all global and external variables, as C requires it in some, but
       not all, system calling conventions.

       `--prefix' is an alias for `--gprefix'.

       See section 8.10 for the equivalent directives and pragmas.

       Earlier versions of NASM called the pragmas `suffix' and the options
       `--postfix', and did not implement directives at all despite being
       so documented. Since NASM 3.01, the directive forms are implemented,
       and directives, pragmas and options all support all spellings.

2.1.29 The `--pragma' Option

       NASM accepts an argument as `%pragma' option, which is like placing
       a `%pragma' preprocess statement at the beginning of the source.
       Running this:

       nasm -f macho --pragma "macho gprefix _"

       is equivalent to the example in section 2.1.28. See section 5.12.

2.1.30 The `--before' Option

       Insert a statement (usually, but not necessarily) a preprocess
       statement before the input file. The example shown in section 2.1.29
       is the same as running this:

       nasm -f macho --before "%pragma macho gprefix _"

2.1.31 The `--bits' Option

       Set the processor mode by inserting a `BITS' directive (kee section
       8.1) before the input file. The following two statements are exactly
       equivalent:

       nasm -f bin --bits 16 file.asm 
       nasm -f bin --before "BITS 16" file.asm

       The `--bits' option was introduced in NASM 3.01; the `--before' form
       can be used for compatibility with older versions of NASM.

2.1.32 The `--limit-' Options

       These options allows user to setup various maximum values after
       which NASM will terminate with a fatal error rather than consume
       arbitrary amount of compute time. Each limit can be set to a
       positive number or `unlimited'.

       (*) `--limit-passes': Number of maximum allowed passes. Default is
           `unlimited'.

       (*) `--limit-stalled-passes': Maximum number of allowed unfinished
           passes. Default is 1000.

       (*) `--limit-macro-levels': Define maximum depth of macro expansion
           (in preprocess). Default is 10000

       (*) `--limit-macro-tokens': Maximum number of tokens processed
           during single-line macro expansion. Default is 10000000.

       (*) `--limit-mmacros': Maximum number of multi-line macros processed
           before returning to the top-level input. Default is 100000.

       (*) `--limit-rep': Maximum number of allowed preprocessor loop,
           defined under `%rep'. Default is 1000000.

       (*) `--limit-eval': This number sets the maximum allowed expression
           length. Default is 8192 on most systems.

       (*) `--limit-lines': Total number of source lines allowed to be
           processed. Default is 2000000000.

       For example, set the maximum line count to 1000:

       nasm --limit-lines 1000

       Limits can also be set via the directive `%pragma limit', for
       example:

       %pragma limit lines 1000

2.1.33 The `--keep-all' Option

       This option prevents NASM from deleting any output files even if an
       error happens.

2.1.34 The `--no-line' Option

       If this option is given, all `%line' directives in the source code
       are ignored. This can be useful for debugging already preprocessed
       code. See section 5.13.1.

2.1.35 The `--reproducible' Option

       If this option is given, NASM will not emit information that is
       inherently dependent on the NASM version or different from run to
       run (such as timestamps) into the output file.

2.1.36 The `NASMENV' Environment Variable

       If you define an environment variable called `NASMENV', the program
       will interpret it as a list of extra command-line options, which are
       processed before the real command line. You can use this to define
       standard search directories for include files, by putting `-i'
       options in the `NASMENV' variable.

       The value of the variable is split up at white space, so that the
       value `-s -ic:\nasmlib\' will be treated as two separate options.
       However, that means that the value `-dNAME="my name"' won't do what
       you might want, because it will be split at the space and the NASM
       command-line processing will get confused by the two nonsensical
       words `-dNAME="my' and `name"'.

       To get round this, NASM provides a feature whereby, if you begin the
       `NASMENV' environment variable with some character that isn't a
       minus sign, then NASM will treat this character as the separator
       character for options. So setting the `NASMENV' variable to the
       value `!-s!-ic:\nasmlib\' is equivalent to setting it to
       `-s -ic:\nasmlib\', but `!-dNAME="my name"' will work.

       This environment variable was previously called `NASM'. This was
       changed with version 0.98.31.

   2.2 Quick Start for MASM Users

       If you're used to writing programs with MASM, or with TASM in MASM-
       compatible (non-Ideal) mode, or with `a86', this section attempts to
       outline the major differences between MASM's syntax and NASM's. If
       you're not already used to MASM, it's probably worth skipping this
       section.

 2.2.1 NASM Is Case-Sensitive

       One simple difference is that NASM is case-sensitive. It makes a
       difference whether you call your label `foo', `Foo' or `FOO'. If
       you're assembling to `DOS' or `OS/2' `.OBJ' files, you can invoke
       the `UPPERCASE' directive (documented in section 9.4) to ensure that
       all symbols exported to other code modules are forced to be upper
       case; but even then, _within_ a single module, NASM will distinguish
       between labels differing only in case.

 2.2.2 NASM Requires Square Brackets For Memory References

       NASM was designed with simplicity of syntax in mind. One of the
       design goals of NASM is that it should be possible, as far as is
       practical, for the user to look at a single line of NASM code and
       tell what opcode is generated by it. You can't do this in MASM: if
       you declare, for example,

       foo     equ     1 
       bar     dw      2

       then the two lines of code

               mov     ax,foo 
               mov     ax,bar

       generate completely different opcodes, despite having identical-
       looking syntaxes.

       NASM avoids this undesirable situation by having a much simpler
       syntax for memory references. The rule is simply that any access to
       the _contents_ of a memory location requires square brackets around
       the address, and any access to the _address_ of a variable doesn't.
       So an instruction of the form `mov ax,foo' will _always_ refer to a
       compile-time constant, whether it's an `EQU' or the address of a
       variable; and to access the _contents_ of the variable `bar', you
       must code `mov ax,[bar]'.

       This also means that NASM has no need for MASM's `OFFSET' keyword,
       since the MASM code `mov ax,offset bar' means exactly the same thing
       as NASM's `mov ax,bar'. If you're trying to get large amounts of
       MASM code to assemble sensibly under NASM, you can always code
       `%idefine offset' to make the preprocessor treat the `OFFSET'
       keyword as a no-op.

       This issue is even more confusing in `a86', where declaring a label
       with a trailing colon defines it to be a `label' as opposed to a
       `variable' and causes `a86' to adopt NASM-style semantics; so in
       `a86', `mov ax,var' has different behaviour depending on whether
       `var' was declared as `var: dw 0' (a label) or `var dw 0' (a word-
       size variable). NASM is very simple by comparison: _everything_ is a
       label.

       NASM, in the interests of simplicity, also does not support the
       hybrid syntaxes supported by MASM and its clones, such as
       `mov ax,table[bx]', where a memory reference is denoted by one
       portion outside square brackets and another portion inside. The
       correct syntax for the above is `mov ax,[table+bx]'. Likewise,
       `mov ax,es:[di]' is wrong and `mov ax,[es:di]' is right.

 2.2.3 NASM Doesn't Store Variable Types

       NASM, by design, chooses not to remember the types of variables you
       declare. Whereas MASM will remember, on seeing `var dw 0', that you
       declared `var' as a word-size variable, and will then be able to
       fill in the ambiguity in the size of the instruction `mov var,2',
       NASM will deliberately remember nothing about the symbol `var'
       except where it begins, and so you must explicitly code
       `mov word [var],2'.

       For this reason, NASM doesn't support the `LODS', `MOVS', `STOS',
       `SCAS', `CMPS', `INS', or `OUTS' instructions, but only supports the
       forms such as `LODSB', `MOVSW', and `SCASD', which explicitly
       specify the size of the components of the strings being manipulated.

 2.2.4 NASM Doesn't `ASSUME'

       As part of NASM's drive for simplicity, it also does not support the
       `ASSUME' directive. NASM will not keep track of what values you
       choose to put in your segment registers, and will never
       _automatically_ generate a segment override prefix.

 2.2.5 NASM Doesn't Support Memory Models

       NASM also does not have any directives to support different 16-bit
       memory models. The programmer has to keep track of which functions
       are supposed to be called with a far call and which with a near
       call, and is responsible for putting the correct form of `RET'
       instruction (`RETN' or `RETF'; NASM accepts `RET' itself as an
       alternate form for `RETN'); in addition, the programmer is
       responsible for coding CALL FAR instructions where necessary when
       calling _external_ functions, and must also keep track of which
       external variable definitions are far and which are near.

 2.2.6 Floating-Point Differences

       NASM uses different names to refer to floating-point registers from
       MASM: where MASM would call them `ST(0)', `ST(1)' and so on, and
       `a86' would call them simply `0', `1' and so on, NASM chooses to
       call them `st0', `st1' etc.

 2.2.7 Other Differences

       For historical reasons, NASM uses the keyword `TWORD' where MASM and
       compatible assemblers use `TBYTE'.

       Historically, NASM does not declare uninitialized storage in the
       same way as MASM: where a MASM programmer might use
       `stack db 64 dup (?)', NASM requires `stack resb 64', intended to be
       read as `reserve 64 bytes'. As of NASM 2.15, the MASM syntax is also
       supported.

       In addition to all of this, macros and directives work completely
       differently to MASM. See chapter 5 and chapter 8 for further
       details.

 2.2.8 MASM compatibility package

       The MASM compatibility macro package can be used to improve MASM
       compatibility. See section 7.5.

Chapter 3: The NASM Language
----------------------------

   3.1 Layout of a NASM Source Line

       Like most assemblers, each NASM source line contains (unless it is a
       macro, a preprocessor directive or an assembler directive: see
       chapter 5 and chapter 8) some combination of the four fields

       label:    instruction operands        ; comment

       As usual, most of these fields are optional; the presence or absence
       of any combination of a label, an instruction and a comment is
       allowed. Of course, the operand field is either required or
       forbidden by the presence and nature of the instruction field.

       NASM uses backslash (\) as the line continuation character; if a
       line ends with backslash, the next line is considered to be a part
       of the backslash-ended line.

       NASM places no restrictions on white space within a line: labels may
       have white space before them, or instructions may have no space
       before them, or anything. The colon after a label is also optional.
       (Note that this means that if you intend to code `lodsb' alone on a
       line, and type `lodab' by accident, then that's still a valid source
       line which does nothing but define a label. Running NASM with the
       command-line option `-w+orphan-labels' will cause it to warn you if
       you define a label alone on a line without a trailing colon.)

       Valid characters in labels are letters, numbers, `_', `$', `#', `@',
       `~', `.', and `?'. The only characters which may be used as the
       _first_ character of an identifier are letters, `.' (with special
       meaning: see section 3.9), `_' and `?'. An identifier may also be
       prefixed with a `$' to indicate that it is intended to be read as an
       identifier and not a reserved word; thus, if some other module you
       are linking with defines a symbol called `eax', you can refer to
       `$eax' in NASM code to distinguish the symbol from the register.
       Maximum length of an identifier is 4095 characters.

       The instruction field may contain any machine instruction: Pentium
       and P6 instructions, FPU instructions, MMX instructions and even
       undocumented instructions are all supported. The instruction may be
       prefixed by `LOCK', `REP', `REPE'/`REPZ', `REPNE'/`REPNZ',
       `XACQUIRE'/`XRELEASE' or `BND'/`NOBND', in the usual way. Explicit
       address-size and operand-size prefixes `A16', `A32', `A64', `O16'
       and `O32', `O64' are provided - one example of their use is given in
       chapter 12. You can also use the name of a segment register as an
       instruction prefix: coding `es mov [bx],ax' is equivalent to coding
       `mov [es:bx],ax'. We recommend the latter syntax, since it is
       consistent with other syntactic features of the language, but for
       instructions such as `LODSB', which has no operands and yet can
       require a segment override, there is no clean syntactic way to
       proceed apart from `es lodsb'.

       An instruction is not required to use a prefix: prefixes such as
       `CS', `A32', `LOCK' or `REPE' can appear on a line by themselves,
       and NASM will just generate the prefix bytes.

       In addition to actual machine instructions, NASM also supports a
       number of pseudo-instructions, described in section 3.2.

       Instruction operands may take a number of forms: they can be
       registers, described simply by the register name (e.g. `ax', `bp',
       `ebx', `cr0': NASM does not use the `gas'-style syntax in which
       register names must be prefixed by a `%' sign), or they can be
       effective addresses (see section 3.3), constants (section 3.4) or
       expressions (section 3.5).

       For x87 floating-point instructions, NASM accepts a wide range of
       syntaxes: you can use two-operand forms like MASM supports, or you
       can use NASM's native single-operand forms in most cases. For
       example, you can code:

               fadd    st1             ; this sets st0 := st0 + st1 
               fadd    st0,st1         ; so does this 
       
               fadd    st1,st0         ; this sets st1 := st1 + st0 
               fadd    to st1          ; so does this

       Almost any x87 floating-point instruction that references memory
       must use one of the prefixes `DWORD', `QWORD' or `TWORD' to indicate
       what size of memory operand it refers to.

   3.2 Pseudo-Instructions

       Pseudo-instructions are things which, though not real x86 machine
       instructions, are used in the instruction field anyway because
       that's the most convenient place to put them. The current pseudo-
       instructions are `DB', `DW', `DD', `DQ', `DT', `DO', `DY' and `DZ';
       their uninitialized counterparts `RESB', `RESW', `RESD', `RESQ',
       `REST', `RESO', `RESY' and `RESZ'; the `INCBIN' command, the `EQU'
       command, and the `TIMES' prefix.

       In this documentation, the notation "`D'_x_" and "`RES'_x_" is used
       to indicate all the `DB' and `RESB' type directives, respectively.

 3.2.1 `D'_x_: Declaring Initialized Data

       `DB', `DW', `DD', `DQ', `DT', `DO', `DY' and `DZ' (collectively
       "`D'_x_" in this documentation) are used, much as in MASM, to
       declare initialized data in the output file. They can be invoked in
       a wide range of ways:

             db    0x55                ; just the byte 0x55 
             db    0x55,0x56,0x57      ; three bytes in succession 
             db    'a',0x55            ; character constants are OK 
             db    'hello',13,10,'$'   ; so are string constants 
             dw    0x1234              ; 0x34 0x12 
             dw    'a'                 ; 0x61 0x00 (it's just a number) 
             dw    'ab'                ; 0x61 0x62 (character constant) 
             dw    'abc'               ; 0x61 0x62 0x63 0x00 (string) 
             dd    0x12345678          ; 0x78 0x56 0x34 0x12 
             dd    1.234567e20         ; floating-point constant 
             dq    0x123456789abcdef0  ; eight byte constant 
             dq    1.234567e20         ; double-precision float 
             dt    1.234567e20         ; extended-precision float

       `DT', `DO', `DY' and `DZ' do not accept integer numeric constants as
       operands.

        Starting in NASM 2.15, a the following MASM-like features have been
       implemented:

       (*) A `?' argument to declare uninitialized storage:

             db    ?                   ; uninitialized

       (*) A superset of the `DUP' syntax. The NASM version of this has the
           following syntax specification; capital letters indicate literal
           keywords:

            dx      := DB | DW | DD | DQ | DT | DO | DY | DZ 
            type    := BYTE | WORD | DWORD | QWORD | TWORD | OWORD | YWORD | ZWORD 
            atom    := expression | string | float | '?' 
            parlist := '(' value [',' value ...] ')' 
            duplist := expression DUP [type] ['%'] parlist 
            list    := duplist | '%' parlist | type ['%'] parlist 
            value   := [type] atom | list 
       
            stmt    := dx value [',' value ...]

           Note that a _list_ needs to be prefixed with a `%' sign unless
           prefixed by either `DUP' or a _type_ in order to avoid confusing
           it with a parenthesis starting an expression. The following
           expressions are all valid:

              db 33 
              db (44)               ; Integer expression 
            ; db (44,55)            ; Invalid - error 
              db %(44,55) 
              db %('XX','YY') 
              db ('AA')             ; Integer expression - outputs single byte 
              db %('BB')            ; List, containing a string 
              db ? 
              db 6 dup (33) 
              db 6 dup (33, 34) 
              db 6 dup (33, 34), 35 
              db 7 dup (99) 
              db 7 dup dword (?, word ?, ?) 
              dw byte (?,44) 
              dw 3 dup (0xcc, 4 dup byte ('PQR'), ?), 0xabcd 
              dd 16 dup (0xaaaa, ?, 0xbbbbbb) 
              dd 64 dup (?)

        The use of `$' (current address) in a `D'_x_ statement is undefined
       in the current version of NASM, _except in the following cases_:

       (*) For the first expression in the statement, either a `DUP' or a
           data item.

       (*) An expression of the form "_value_` - $'", which is converted to
           a self-relative relocation.

       Future versions of NASM is likely to produce a different result or
       issue an error this case.

       There is no such restriction on using `$$' or section-relative
       symbols.

 3.2.2 `RESB' and Friends: Declaring Uninitialized Data

       `RESB', `RESW', `RESD', `RESQ', `REST', `RESO', `RESY' and `RESZ'
       are designed to be used in the BSS section of a module: they declare
       _uninitialized_ storage space. Each takes a single operand, which is
       the number of bytes, words, doublewords or whatever to reserve. The
       operand to a `RESB'-type pseudo-instruction _would_ be a _critical
       expression_ (see section 3.8), except that for legacy compatibility
       reasons forward references are permitted, however _the code will be
       extremely fragile and this should be considered a severe programming
       error._ A warning will be issued; code generating this warning
       should be remedied as quickly as possible (see the `forward' class
       in appendix A.)

       For example:

       buffer:         resb    64              ; reserve 64 bytes 
       wordvar:        resw    1               ; reserve a word 
       realarray       resq    10              ; array of ten reals 
       ymmval:         resy    1               ; one YMM register 
       zmmvals:        resz    32              ; 32 ZMM registers

        Since NASM 2.15, the MASM syntax of using `?' and `DUP' in the
       `D'_x_ directives is also supported. Thus, the above example could
       also be written:

       buffer:         db      64 dup (?)      ; reserve 64 bytes 
       wordvar:        dw      ?               ; reserve a word 
       realarray       dq      10 dup (?)      ; array of ten reals 
       ymmval:         dy      ?               ; one YMM register 
       zmmvals:        dz      32 dup (?)      ; 32 ZMM registers

 3.2.3 `INCBIN': Including External Binary Files

       `INCBIN' includes binary file data verbatim into the output file.
       This can be handy for (for example) including graphics and sound
       data directly into a game executable file. It can be called in one
       of these three ways:

           incbin  "file.dat"             ; include the whole file 
           incbin  "file.dat",1024        ; skip the first 1024 bytes 
           incbin  "file.dat",1024,512    ; skip the first 1024, and 
                                          ; actually include at most 512

       `INCBIN' is both a directive and a standard macro; the standard
       macro version searches for the file in the include file search path
       and adds the file to the dependency lists. This macro can be
       overridden if desired.

 3.2.4 `EQU': Defining Constants

       `EQU' defines a symbol to a given constant value: when `EQU' is
       used, the source line must contain a label. The action of `EQU' is
       to define the given label name to the value of its (only) operand.
       This definition is absolute, and cannot change later. So, for
       example,

       message         db      'hello, world' 
       msglen          equ     $-message

       defines `msglen' to be the constant 12. `msglen' may not then be
       redefined later. This is not a preprocessor definition either: the
       value of `msglen' is evaluated _once_, using the value of `$' (see
       section 3.5 for an explanation of `$') at the point of definition,
       rather than being evaluated wherever it is referenced and using the
       value of `$' at the point of reference.

 3.2.5 `TIMES': Repeating Instructions or Data

       The `TIMES' prefix causes the instruction to be assembled multiple
       times. This is partly present as NASM's equivalent of the `DUP'
       syntax supported by MASM-compatible assemblers, in that you can code

       zerobuf:        times 64 db 0

       or similar things; but `TIMES' is more versatile than that. The
       argument to `TIMES' is not just a numeric constant, but a numeric
       _expression_, so you can do things like

       buffer: db      'hello, world' 
               times 64-$+buffer db ' '

       which will store exactly enough spaces to make the total length of
       `buffer' up to 64. Finally, `TIMES' can be applied to ordinary
       instructions, so you can code trivial unrolled loops in it:

               times 100 movsb

       Note that there is no effective difference between
       `times 100 resb 1' and `resb 100', except that the latter will be
       assembled about 100 times faster due to the internal structure of
       the assembler.

       The operand to `TIMES' is a critical expression (section 3.8).

       Note also that `TIMES' can't be applied to macros: the reason for
       this is that `TIMES' is processed after the macro phase, which
       allows the argument to `TIMES' to contain expressions such as
       `64-$+buffer' as above. To repeat more than one line of code, or a
       complex macro, use the preprocessor `%rep' directive.

   3.3 Effective Addresses

       An effective address is any operand to an instruction which
       references memory. Effective addresses, in NASM, have a very simple
       syntax: they consist of an expression evaluating to the desired
       address, enclosed in square brackets. For example:

       wordvar dw      123 
               mov     ax,[wordvar] 
               mov     ax,[wordvar+1] 
               mov     ax,[es:wordvar+bx]

       Anything not conforming to this simple system is not a valid memory
       reference in NASM, for example `es:wordvar[bx]'.

       More complicated effective addresses, such as those involving more
       than one register, work in exactly the same way:

               mov     eax,[ebx*2+ecx+offset] 
               mov     ax,[bp+di+8]

       NASM is capable of doing algebra on these effective addresses, so
       that things which don't necessarily _look_ legal are perfectly all
       right:

           mov     eax,[ebx*5]             ; assembles as [ebx*4+ebx] 
           mov     eax,[label1*2-label2]   ; ie [label1+(label1-label2)]

       Some forms of effective address have more than one assembled form;
       in most such cases NASM will generate the smallest form it can. For
       example, there are distinct assembled forms for the 32-bit effective
       addresses `[eax*2+0]' and `[eax+eax]', and NASM will generally
       generate the latter on the grounds that the former requires four
       bytes to store a zero offset.

       NASM has a hinting mechanism which will cause `[eax+ebx]' and
       `[ebx+eax]' to generate different opcodes; this is occasionally
       useful because `[esi+ebp]' and `[ebp+esi]' have different default
       segment registers.

       However, you can force NASM to generate an effective address in a
       particular form by the use of the keywords `BYTE', `WORD', `DWORD'
       and `NOSPLIT'. If you need `[eax+3]' to be assembled using a double-
       word offset field instead of the one byte NASM will normally
       generate, you can code `[dword eax+3]'. Similarly, you can force
       NASM to use a byte offset for a small value which it hasn't seen on
       the first pass (see section 3.8 for an example of such a code
       fragment) by using `[byte eax+offset]'. As special cases,
       `[byte eax]' will code `[eax+0]' with a byte offset of zero, and
       `[dword eax]' will code it with a double-word offset of zero. The
       normal form, `[eax]', will be coded with no offset field.

       The form described in the previous paragraph is also useful if you
       are trying to access data in a 32-bit segment from within 16 bit
       code. For more information on this see the section on mixed-size
       addressing (section 12.2). In particular, if you need to access data
       with a known offset that is larger than will fit in a 16-bit value,
       if you don't specify that it is a dword offset, nasm will cause the
       high word of the offset to be lost.

       Similarly, NASM will split `[eax*2]' into `[eax+eax]' because that
       allows the offset field to be absent and space to be saved; in fact,
       it will also split `[eax*2+offset]' into `[eax+eax+offset]'. You can
       combat this behaviour by the use of the `NOSPLIT' keyword:
       `[nosplit eax*2]' will force `[eax*2+0]' to be generated literally.
       `[nosplit eax*1]' also has the same effect. In another way, a split
       EA form `[0, eax*2]' can be used, too. However, `NOSPLIT' in
       `[nosplit eax+eax]' will be ignored because user's intention here is
       considered as `[eax+eax]'.

       In 64-bit mode, NASM will by default generate absolute addresses.
       The `REL' keyword makes it produce `RIP'-relative addresses. Since
       this is frequently the normally desired behaviour, see the `DEFAULT'
       directive (section 8.2). The keyword `ABS' overrides `REL'.

       A new syntax for split EA (effective addressing) is also supported
       in NASM. It's mainly intended for MPX instructions that use the MIB
       operands, but it can be used for any memory reference. It's
       described in more detail in section 4.4.

       When broadcasting decorator is used, the opsize keyword should match
       the size of each element.

            VDIVPS zmm4, zmm5, dword [rbx]{1to16}   ; single-precision float 
            VDIVPS zmm4, zmm5, zword [rbx]          ; packed 512 bit memory

   3.4 Constants

       NASM understands four different types of constant: numeric,
       character, string and floating-point.

 3.4.1 Numeric Constants

       A numeric constant is simply a number. NASM allows you to specify
       numbers in a variety of number bases, in a variety of ways: you can
       suffix `H' or `X', `D' or `T', `Q' or `O', and `B' or `Y' for
       hexadecimal, decimal, octal and binary respectively, or you can
       prefix `0h' or `0x', `0d' or `0t', `0q' or `0o', and `0b' or `0y')
       in the style of C. Please note that unlike C, a `0' prefix by itself
       does _not_ imply an octal constant (this is deprecated in C23.)

       Previous versions of NASM allowed prefixing `$' for hexadecimal in
       the style of Borland Pascal or Motorola Assemblers. Unfortunately
       though, the `$' prefix does double duty as a prefix on identifiers
       (see section 3.1), so a hex number prefixed with a `$' sign would
       have to have a digit after the `$' rather than a letter, which is
       _not_ what users would typically expect. This syntax is strongly
       deprecated, and can be disabled entirely with the `[DOLLARHEX]'
       directive, see section 8.12.

       Numeric constants can have underscores (`_') interspersed to break
       up long strings.

       Some examples (all producing exactly the same code):

               mov     ax,200          ; decimal 
               mov     ax,0200         ; still decimal 
               mov     ax,0200d        ; explicitly decimal 
               mov     ax,0d200        ; also decimal 
               mov     ax,0c8h         ; hex 
               mov     ax,0xc8         ; hex yet again 
               mov     ax,0hc8         ; still hex 
               mov     ax,310q         ; octal 
               mov     ax,310o         ; octal again 
               mov     ax,0o310        ; octal yet again 
               mov     ax,0q310        ; octal yet again 
               mov     ax,11001000b    ; binary 
               mov     ax,1100_1000b   ; same binary constant 
               mov     ax,1100_1000y   ; same binary constant once more 
               mov     ax,0b1100_1000  ; same binary constant yet again 
               mov     ax,0y1100_1000  ; same binary constant yet again 
       
               ; Deprecated syntax: 
               mov     ax,$0c8         ; hex again: the 0 is required

 3.4.2 Character Strings

       A character string consists of up to eight characters enclosed in
       either single quotes (`'...''), double quotes (`"..."') or
       backquotes (``...`'). Single or double quotes are equivalent in NASM
       (except of course that surrounding the constant with single quotes
       allows double quotes to appear within it and vice versa); the
       contents of those are represented verbatim. Strings enclosed in
       backquotes support C-style `\'-escapes for special characters.

       The following escape sequences are recognized by backquoted strings:

             \'          single quote (') 
             \"          double quote (") 
             \`          backquote (`) 
             \\          backslash (\) 
             \?          question mark (?) 
             \a          BEL (ASCII 7) 
             \b          BS  (ASCII 8) 
             \t          TAB (ASCII 9) 
             \n          LF  (ASCII 10) 
             \v          VT  (ASCII 11) 
             \f          FF  (ASCII 12) 
             \r          CR  (ASCII 13) 
             \e          ESC (ASCII 27) 
             \377        Up to 3 octal digits - literal byte 
             \xFF        Up to 2 hexadecimal digits - literal byte 
             \u1234      4 hexadecimal digits - Unicode character 
             \U12345678  8 hexadecimal digits - Unicode character

       All other escape sequences are reserved. Note that `\0', meaning a
       `NUL' character (ASCII 0), is a special case of the octal escape
       sequence.

       Unicode characters specified with `\u' or `\U' are converted to
       UTF-8. For example, the following lines are all equivalent:

             db `\u263a`            ; UTF-8 smiley face 
             db `\xe2\x98\xba`      ; UTF-8 smiley face 
             db 0E2h, 098h, 0BAh    ; UTF-8 smiley face

 3.4.3 Character Constants

       A character constant consists of a string up to eight bytes long,
       used in an expression context. It is treated as if it was an
       integer.

       A character constant with more than one byte will be arranged with
       little-endian order in mind: if you code

                 mov eax,'abcd'

       then the constant generated is not `0x61626364', but `0x64636261',
       so that if you were then to store the value into memory, it would
       read `abcd' rather than `dcba'. This is also the sense of character
       constants understood by the Pentium's `CPUID' instruction.

 3.4.4 String Constants

       String constants are character strings used in the context of some
       pseudo-instructions, namely the `DB' family and `INCBIN' (where it
       represents a filename). They are also used in certain preprocessor
       directives.

       A string constant looks like a character constant, only longer. It
       is treated as a concatenation of maximum-size character constants
       for the conditions. So the following are equivalent:

             db    'hello'               ; string constant 
             db    'h','e','l','l','o'   ; equivalent character constants

       And the following are also equivalent:

             dd    'ninechars'           ; doubleword string constant 
             dd    'nine','char','s'     ; becomes three doublewords 
             db    'ninechars',0,0,0     ; and really looks like this

       Note that when used in a string-supporting context, quoted strings
       are treated as a string constants even if they are short enough to
       be a character constant, because otherwise `db 'ab'' would have the
       same effect as `db 'a'', which would be silly. Similarly, three-
       character or four-character constants are treated as strings when
       they are operands to `DW', and so forth.

 3.4.5 Unicode Strings

       The special operators `__?utf16?__', `__?utf16le?__',
       `__?utf16be?__', `__?utf32?__', `__?utf32le?__' and `__?utf32be?__'
       allows definition of Unicode strings. They take a string in UTF-8
       format and converts it to UTF-16 or UTF-32, respectively. Unless the
       `be' forms are specified, the output is little endian.

       For example:

       %define u(x) __?utf16?__(x) 
       %define w(x) __?utf32?__(x) 
       
             dw u('C:\WINDOWS'), 0       ; Pathname in UTF-16 
             dd w(`A + B = \u206a`), 0   ; String in UTF-32

       The UTF operators can be applied either to strings passed to the
       `DB' family instructions, or to character constants in an expression
       context.

 3.4.6 Floating-Point Constants

       Floating-point constants are acceptable only as arguments to `DB',
       `DW', `DD', `DQ', `DT', and `DO', or as arguments to the special
       operators `__?float8?__', `__?float16?__', `__?bfloat16?__',
       `__?float32?__', `__?float64?__', `__?float80m?__',
       `__?float80e?__', `__?float128l?__', and `__?float128h?__'. See also
       section 7.3.

       Floating-point constants are expressed in the traditional form:
       digits, then a period, then optionally more digits, then optionally
       an `E' followed by an exponent. The period is mandatory, so that
       NASM can distinguish between `dd 1', which declares an integer
       constant, and `dd 1.0' which declares a floating-point constant.

       NASM also support C99-style hexadecimal floating-point: `0x',
       hexadecimal digits, period, optionally more hexadeximal digits, then
       optionally a `P' followed by a _binary_ (not hexadecimal) exponent
       in decimal notation. As an extension, NASM additionally supports the
       `0h' and `$' prefixes for hexadecimal, as well binary and octal
       floating-point, using the `0b' or `0y' and `0o' or `0q' prefixes,
       respectively. As with integers, the `$' prefix for hexadecimal is
       deprecated.

       Underscores to break up groups of digits are permitted in floating-
       point constants as well.

       Some examples:

             db    -0.2                    ; "Quarter precision" 
             dw    -0.5                    ; IEEE 754r/SSE5 half precision 
             dd    1.2                     ; an easy one 
             dd    1.222_222_222           ; underscores are permitted 
             dd    0x1p+2                  ; 1.0x2^2 = 4.0 
             dq    0x1p+32                 ; 1.0x2^32 = 4 294 967 296.0 
             dq    1.e10                   ; 10 000 000 000.0 
             dq    1.e+10                  ; synonymous with 1.e10 
             dq    1.e-10                  ; 0.000 000 000 1 
             dt    3.141592653589793238462 ; pi 
             do    1.e+4000                ; IEEE 754r quad precision

       The 8-bit "quarter-precision" floating-point format is
       sign:exponent:mantissa = 1:4:3 with an exponent bias of 7. This
       appears to be the most frequently used 8-bit floating-point format,
       although it is not covered by any formal standard. This is sometimes
       called a "minifloat."

       The `bfloat16' format is effectively a compressed version of the 32-
       bit single precision format, with a reduced mantissa. It is
       effectively the same as truncating the 32-bit format to the upper 16
       bits, except for rounding. There is no `D'_x_ directive that
       corresponds to `bfloat16' as it obviously has the same size as the
       IEEE standard 16-bit half precision format, see however section 7.3.

       The special operators are used to produce floating-point numbers in
       other contexts. They produce the binary representation of a specific
       floating-point number as an integer, and can use anywhere integer
       constants are used in an expression. `__?float80m?__' and
       `__?float80e?__' produce the 64-bit mantissa and 16-bit exponent of
       an 80-bit floating-point number, and `__?float128l?__' and
       `__?float128h?__' produce the lower and upper 64-bit halves of a
       128-bit floating-point number, respectively.

       For example:

             mov    rax,__?float64?__(3.141592653589793238462)

       ... would assign the binary representation of pi as a 64-bit
       floating point number into `RAX'. This is exactly equivalent to:

             mov    rax,0x400921fb54442d18

       NASM cannot do compile-time arithmetic on floating-point constants.
       This is because NASM is designed to be portable - although it always
       generates code to run on x86 processors, the assembler itself can
       run on any system with an ANSI C compiler. Therefore, the assembler
       cannot guarantee the presence of a floating-point unit capable of
       handling the Intel number formats, and so for NASM to be able to do
       floating arithmetic it would have to include its own complete set of
       floating-point routines, which would significantly increase the size
       of the assembler for very little benefit.

       The special tokens `__?Infinity?__', `__?QNaN?__' (or `__?NaN?__')
       and `__?SNaN?__' can be used to generate infinities, quiet NaNs, and
       signalling NaNs, respectively. These are normally used as macros:

       %define Inf __?Infinity?__ 
       %define NaN __?QNaN?__ 
       
             dq    +1.5, -Inf, NaN         ; Double-precision constants

       The `%use fp' standard macro package contains a set of convenience
       macros. See section 7.3.

 3.4.7 Packed BCD Constants

       x87-style packed BCD constants can be used in the same contexts as
       80-bit floating-point numbers. They are suffixed with `p' or
       prefixed with `0p', and can include up to 18 decimal digits.

       As with other numeric constants, underscores can be used to separate
       digits.

       For example:

             dt 12_345_678_901_245_678p 
             dt -12_345_678_901_245_678p 
             dt +0p33 
             dt 33p

   3.5 Expressions

       Expressions in NASM are similar in syntax to those in C. Expressions
       are evaluated as 64-bit integers which are then adjusted to the
       appropriate size.

       NASM supports two special tokens in expressions, allowing
       calculations to involve the current assembly position: the `$' and
       `$$' tokens. `$' evaluates to the assembly position at the beginning
       of the line containing the expression; so you can code an infinite
       loop using `JMP $'. `$$' evaluates to the beginning of the current
       section; so you can tell how far into the section you are by using
       `($-$$)'.

       The arithmetic operators provided by NASM are listed here, in
       increasing order of precedence.

       A _boolean_ value is true if nonzero and false if zero. The
       operators which return a boolean value always return 1 for true and
       0 for false.

 3.5.1 `?' ... `:': Conditional Operator

       The syntax of this operator, similar to the C conditional operator,
       is:

       _boolean_ `?' _trueval_ `:' _falseval_

       This operator evaluates to _trueval_ if _boolean_ is true, otherwise
       to _falseval_.

       Note that NASM allows `?' characters in symbol names. Therefore, it
       is highly advisable to always put spaces around the `?' and `:'
       characters.

 3.5.2 : `||': Boolean OR Operator

       The `||' operator gives a boolean OR: it evaluates to 1 if both
       sides of the expression are nonzero, otherwise 0.

 3.5.3 : `^^': Boolean XOR Operator

       The `^^' operator gives a boolean XOR: it evaluates to 1 if any one
       side of the expression is nonzero, otherwise 0.

 3.5.4 : `&&': Boolean AND Operator

       The `&&' operator gives a boolean AND: it evaluates to 1 if both
       sides of the expression is nonzero, otherwise 0.

 3.5.5 : Comparison Operators

       NASM supports the following comparison operators:

       (*) `=' or `==' compare for equality.

       (*) `!=' or `<>' compare for inequality.

       (*) `<' compares signed less than.

       (*) `<=' compares signed less than or equal.

       (*) `>' compares signed greater than.

       (*) `>=' compares signed greater than or equal.

       These operators evaluate to 0 for false or 1 for true.

       (*) <=> does a signed comparison, and evaluates to -1 for less than,
           0 for equal, and 1 for greater than.

       At this time, NASM does not provide unsigned comparison operators.

 3.5.6 `|': Bitwise OR Operator

       The `|' operator gives a bitwise OR, exactly as performed by the
       `OR' machine instruction.

 3.5.7 `^': Bitwise XOR Operator

       `^' provides the bitwise XOR operation.

 3.5.8 `&': Bitwise AND Operator

       `&' provides the bitwise AND operation.

 3.5.9 Bit Shift Operators

       `<<' gives a bit-shift to the left, just as it does in C. So `5<<3'
       evaluates to 5 times 8, or 40. `>>' gives an _unsigned_ (logical)
       bit-shift to the right; the bits shifted in from the left are set to
       zero.

       `<<<' gives a bit-shift to the left, exactly equivalent to the `<<'
       operator; it is included for completeness. `>>>' gives an _signed_
       (arithmetic) bit-shift to the right; the bits shifted in from the
       left are filled with copies of the most significant (sign) bit.

3.5.10 `+' and `-': Addition and Subtraction Operators

       The `+' and `-' operators do perfectly ordinary addition and
       subtraction.

3.5.11 Multiplication, Division and Modulo

       `*' is the multiplication operator.

       `/' and `//' are both division operators: `/' is unsigned division
       and `//' is signed division.

       Similarly, `%' and `%%' provide unsigned and signed modulo operators
       respectively.

       Since the `%' character is used extensively by the macro
       preprocessor, you should ensure that both the signed and unsigned
       modulo operators are followed by white space wherever they appear.

       NASM, like ANSI C, provides no guarantees about the sensible
       operation of the signed modulo operator. On most systems it will
       match the signed division operator, such that:

            b * (a // b) + (a %% b) = a       (b != 0)

3.5.12 Unary Operators

       The highest-priority operators in NASM's expression grammar are
       those which only apply to one argument. These are:

       (*) `-' negates (2's complement) its operand.

       (*) `+' does nothing; it's provided for symmetry with `-'.

       (*) `~' computes the bitwise negation (1's complement) of its
           operand.

       (*) `!' is the boolean negation operator. It evaluates to 1 if the
           argument is 0, otherwise 0.

       (*) `SEG' provides the segment address of its operand (explained in
           more detail in section 3.6).

       (*) A set of additional operators with leading and trailing double
           underscores are used to implement the `integer functions' of the
           `ifunc' macro package, see section 7.4.

   3.6 `SEG' and `WRT'

       When writing large 16-bit programs, which must be split into
       multiple segments, it is often necessary to be able to refer to the
       segment part of the address of a symbol. NASM supports the `SEG'
       operator to perform this function.

       The `SEG' operator evaluates to the _preferred_ segment base of a
       symbol, defined as the segment base relative to which the offset of
       the symbol makes sense. So the code

               mov     ax,seg symbol 
               mov     es,ax 
               mov     bx,symbol

       will load `ES:BX' with a valid pointer to the symbol `symbol'.

       Things can be more complex than this: since 16-bit segments and
       groups may overlap, you might occasionally want to refer to some
       symbol using a different segment base from the preferred one. NASM
       lets you do this, by the use of the `WRT' (With Reference To)
       keyword. So you can do things like

               mov     ax,weird_seg        ; weird_seg is a segment base 
               mov     es,ax 
               mov     bx,symbol wrt weird_seg

       to load `ES:BX' with a different, but functionally equivalent,
       pointer to the symbol `symbol'.

       The `WRT' keyword is also used in far (inter-segment) calls and
       jumps. It's synonymous to the

            call far procedure

       syntax which is documented in section 4.1.5.

   3.7 `STRICT': Inhibiting Optimization

       When assembling with the optimizer set to level 2 or higher (see
       section 2.1.24), NASM will use size specifiers (`BYTE', `WORD',
       `DWORD', `QWORD', `TWORD', `OWORD', `YWORD' or `ZWORD'), but will
       give them the smallest possible size. The keyword `STRICT' can be
       used to inhibit optimization and force a particular operand to be
       emitted in the specified size. For example, with the optimizer on,
       and in `BITS 16' mode,

               push dword 33

       is encoded in three bytes `66 6A 21', whereas

               push strict dword 33

       is encoded in six bytes, with a full dword immediate operand
       `66 68 21 00 00 00'.

       With the optimizer off, the same code (six bytes) is generated
       whether the `STRICT' keyword was used or not.

   3.8 Critical Expressions

       Although NASM has an optional multi-pass optimizer, there are some
       expressions which must be resolvable on the first pass. These are
       called _Critical Expressions_.

       The first pass is used to determine the size of all the assembled
       code and data, so that the second pass, when generating all the
       code, knows all the symbol addresses the code refers to. So one
       thing NASM can't handle is code whose size depends on the value of a
       symbol declared after the code in question. For example,

               times (label-$) db 0 
       label:  db      'Where am I?'

       The argument to `TIMES' in this case could equally legally evaluate
       to anything at all; NASM will reject this example because it cannot
       tell the size of the `TIMES' line when it first sees it. It will
       just as firmly reject the slightly paradoxical code

               times (label-$+1) db 0 
       label:  db      'NOW where am I?'

       in which _any_ value for the `TIMES' argument is by definition
       wrong!

       NASM rejects these examples by means of a concept called a _critical
       expression_, which is defined to be an expression whose value is
       required to be computable in the first pass, and which must
       therefore depend only on symbols defined before it. The argument to
       the `TIMES' prefix is a critical expression.

   3.9 Local Labels

       NASM gives special treatment to symbols beginning with a period. A
       label beginning with a single period is treated as a _local_ label,
       which means that it is associated with the previous non-local label.
       So, for example:

       label1  ; some code 
       
       .loop 
               ; some more code 
       
               jne     .loop 
               ret 
       
       label2  ; some code 
       
       .loop 
               ; some more code 
       
               jne     .loop 
               ret

       In the above code fragment, each `JNE' instruction jumps to the line
       immediately before it, because the two definitions of `.loop' are
       kept separate by virtue of each being associated with the previous
       non-local label.

       This form of local label handling is borrowed from the old Amiga
       assembler DevPac; however, NASM goes one step further, in allowing
       access to local labels from other parts of the code. This is
       achieved by means of _defining_ a local label in terms of the
       previous non-local label: the first definition of `.loop' above is
       really defining a symbol called `label1.loop', and the second
       defines a symbol called `label2.loop'. So, if you really needed to,
       you could write

       label3  ; some more code 
               ; and some more 
       
               jmp label1.loop

       Sometimes it is useful - in a macro, for instance - to be able to
       define a label which can be referenced from anywhere but which
       doesn't interfere with the normal local-label mechanism. Such a
       label can't be non-local because it would interfere with subsequent
       definitions of, and references to, local labels; and it can't be
       local because the macro that defined it wouldn't know the label's
       full name. NASM therefore introduces a third type of label, which is
       probably only useful in macro definitions: if a label begins with
       the special prefix `..@', then it does nothing to the local label
       mechanism. So you could code

       label1:                         ; a non-local label 
       .local:                         ; this is really label1.local 
       ..@foo:                         ; this is a special symbol 
       label2:                         ; another non-local label 
       .local:                         ; this is really label2.local 
       
               jmp     ..@foo          ; this will jump three lines up

       NASM has the capacity to define other special symbols beginning with
       a double period: for example, `..start' is used to specify the entry
       point in the `obj' output format (see section 9.4.6), `..imagebase'
       is used to find out the offset from a base address of the current
       image in the `win64' output format (see section 9.7.1). So just keep
       in mind that symbols beginning with a double period are special.

Chapter 4: Syntax Quirks and Summaries
--------------------------------------

   4.1 Summary of the `JMP' and `CALL' Syntax

       The `JMP' and `CALL' instructions support a variety of syntaxes to
       simplify their specific use cases. Some of the following chapters
       explain how these two instructions interact with various special
       symbols that NASM uses and some document non-obvious scenarios
       regarding differently sized modes of operation.

 4.1.1 Near Jumps

       Near jumps are jumps within a single segment. Probably the most
       common way to use them is through labels, as explained in section
       3.9. `APX' added a near jump instruction - , that allows jumps to
       any 64-bit address specified with an immediate operand. The
       instruction works with absolute addresses and the syntax options are
       shown in section 4.1.6.

 4.1.2 Infinite Loop Trick

       One of the ways to quickly implement an infinite loop is using the
       `$' token which evaluates to the current position in the code. So a
       one line infinite loop can simply look like:

            jmp $

 4.1.3 Jumps and Mixed Sizes

       In some special circumstances one might need to jump between 16-bit
       mode and 32-bit mode. A similar issue is addressing between 16 and
       32 bit segments. The possible cases and the relevant syntax for both
       problems are explained in section 12.1 and section 12.2
       respectively.

 4.1.4 Calling Procedures Outside of a Shared Library

       When writing shared libraries it's often necessary to call external
       code. In the ELF format the  keyword takes on a different meaning
       than normally when it helps reference a segment - it's used to refer
       to some special symbols (more about it can be found in section
       9.7.1). In the case described here, "`wrt' `..plt'" references a PLT
       (procedure linkage table) entry. It can be used to call external
       routines in a way explained in section 11.2.5.

 4.1.5 `FAR' Calls and Jumps

       NASM supports `FAR' (inter-segment) calls and jumps by means of the
       syntax `call segment:offset', where `segment' and `offset' both
       represent immediate values. So to call a far procedure, you could
       code either of

               call    (seg procedure):procedure 
               call    weird_seg:(procedure wrt weird_seg)

       (The parentheses are included for clarity, to show the intended
       parsing of the above instructions. They are not necessary in
       practice.)

       NASM also supports the syntax `call far procedure' as a synonym for
       the first of the above usages. `JMP' works identically to `CALL' in
       these examples.

       To declare a far pointer to a data item in a data segment, you must
       code

               dw symbol, seg symbol                ; 16 bit 
               dd symbol, word seg symbol           ; 32 bit

       NASM supports no convenient synonym for this, though you can always
       invent one using the macro processor.

 4.1.6 64-bit absolute jump (`JMPABS')

       Defined as part of the APX specification, `JMPABS' is a new near
       jump instruction takes a 64-bit _absolute_ address immediate. It is
       the only _direct_ jump instruction that can jump anywhere in the
       address space in 64-bit mode.

       NASM allows this instruction to be specified either as:

            jmpabs target

       ... or:

            jmp abs target

       The generated code is identical. The `ABS' is required regardless of
       the `DEFAULT' setting.

   4.2 Compact NDS/NDD Operands

       Some instructions that use the `VEX' prefix, mainly AVX ones, use
       NDS (Non-Destructive Source) or NDD (New Data Destination) operands.
       Semantically it works by passing another operand to the instruction
       so that none of the source operands are modified as a result of the
       operation.

       Syntatically NASM allows both the obvious format mentioned above and
       a compact format - compact meaning that if a user passes two
       operands instead of three, one of them is simply copied to be used
       as the source or destination. Thereby these instructions have
       exactly the same encoding:

            vaddpd xmm0, xmm0, xmm1 
            vaddpd xmm0, xmm1

       Here the `XMM0' register is used as the "non-destructive source"
       even though in this case it will of course be modified.

   4.3 64-bit _moffs_

       The _moffs_ operand can be used with the `MOV' instruction, only
       using the "`A'" register (`AL', `AX', `EAX', or `RAX'), and for non-
       64-bit operand size means to address memory at an offset from a
       segment. For 64-bit operands it simply accesses memory at a
       specified offset (since segment based addressing is mostly
       unavailable in 64-bit mode). Syntax to use 64-bit offsets to address
       memory is showcased in section 13.2.2.

   4.4 Split EA Addressing Syntax

       Instructions that use the mib operand, (that is memory addressed
       with a base register, with some offset, with an added index register
       that's multiplied by some scale factor) can also utilize the split
       EA (effective addressing). The new form is mainly intended for MPX
       instructions that use the mib operands, but can be used for any
       memory reference. The basic concept of this form is splitting base
       and index:

            mov eax,[ebx+8,ecx*4]   ; ebx=base, ecx=index, 4=scale, 8=disp

       NASM supports all currently possible forms of the mib syntax:

            ; bndstx 
            ; next 5 lines are parsed same 
            ; base=rax, index=rbx, scale=1, displacement=3 
            bndstx [rax+0x3,rbx], bnd0      ; NASM - split EA 
            bndstx [rbx*1+rax+0x3], bnd0    ; GAS - '*1' indecates an index reg 
            bndstx [rax+rbx+3], bnd0        ; GAS - without hints 
            bndstx [rax+0x3], bnd0, rbx     ; ICC-1 
            bndstx [rax+0x3], rbx, bnd0     ; ICC-2

   4.5 No Syntax for Ternary Logic Instruction

       `VPTERNLOGD' and `VPTERNLOGQ' are instructions that implement an
       arbitrary logic function for three inputs. They take three register
       operands and one immediate value that determines what logic function
       the instruction shall implement on execution. Specifically the
       output of the desired logic function is encoded in the immediate 8-
       bit operand. 3 binary inputs can be configured in 8 possible ways
       giving 8 output bits that could implement any one of 256 possible
       logic functions. Therefore it's not practical to have any syntax
       around different possible logic functions.

       However there are some macro solutions that can help avoid writing
       out truth tables in order to use the ternary logic instructions. The
       simple, more manual way is to calculate the logic operation encoding
       on the fly with a few lines of arithmetic directives:

            a equ 0xaa 
            b equ 0xcc 
            c equ 0xf0 
            imm equ a | b & c

       Here, values for "a", "b" and "c" together are all possible bit
       configurations that a 3 input function can take ("a" being the least
       significant bit and "c" being the most significant one). Then the
       "imm" variable is calculated by evaluating the desired logic
       function, in this case "a or b and c", thereby getting the
       function's output column that one would get when writing out the
       truth tables.

       Note that only the expression must be written using the bitwise
       operators `&', `|', `^', and `~'. Using the boolean operators `&&',
       `||', `^^', `!' and `? :' will not work correctly.

       The `vtern' standard macro package, section 7.6, allows for these
       kinds of expressions without introducing the symbols `a', `b' and
       `c' into the global namespace:

       %use vtern 
            vpternlogd xmm1, xmm2, xmm3, a | b & c 
            vpternlogq ymm4, ymm5, xmm6, (b ^ c) & ~a 
            ; a, b, and c are not defined as symbols elsewhere

   4.6 APX Instruction Syntax

       Intel APX (Advanced Performance Extensions) introduces multiple new
       features, mostly to existing instructions. APX is only available in
       64-bit mode.

       (*) There are 16 new general purpose registers, `R16' to `R31'.

       (*) Many instructions now support a non-destructive destination
           operand.

       (*) The ability to suppress the setting of the arithmetic flags.

       (*) The ability to zero the upper parts of a full 64-bit register
           for 8- and 16-bit operation size instructions. (This zeroing is
           always performed for 32-bit operations; this has been the case
           since 64-bit mode was first introduced.)

       (*) New instructions to conditionally set the arithmetic flags to a
           user-specified value.

       (*) Performance-enhanced versions of the `PUSH' and `POP'
           instructions.

       (*) A 64-bit absolute jump instruction.

       (*) A new REX2 prefix.

       See `https://www.nasm.us/specs/apx' for a link to the APX technical
       documentation. NASM generally follows the syntax specified in the
       _Assembly Syntax Recommendations for Intel APX_ document although
       some syntax is relaxed, see below.

 4.6.1 Extended General Purpose Registers (EGPRs)

       When it comes to register size, the new registers (`R16'-`R31') work
       the same way as registers `R8'-`R15' (see also section 13.1):

       (*) `R31' is the 64-bit form of register 31,

       (*) `R31D' is the 32-bit form,

       (*) `R31W' is the 16-bit form, and

       (*) `R31B' is the 8-bit form. The form `R31L' can also be used if
           the `altreg' macro package is used (`%use altreg'), see section
           7.1.

       Extended registers require that either a REX2 prefix (the default,
       if possible) or an EVEX prefix is used.

       There are some instructions that don't support EGPRs. In that case,
       NASM will generate an error if they are used.

 4.6.2 New Data Destination (NDD)

       Using the new data destination register (when supported) is
       specified by adding an additional register in place of the first
       operand. For example an `ADD' instruction:

            add rax, rbx, rcx

       ... which would add `RBX' and `RCX' and store the result in `RAX',
       without modifying neither `RBX' nor `RCX'.

 4.6.3 Suppress Modifying Flags (NF)

       The `{nf}' prefix on a supported instruction inhibits the update of
       the flags, for example:

            {nf} add rax, rbx

       ... will add `RAX' and `RBX' together, storing the result in `RAX',
       while leaving the flags register unchanged.

       NASM also allows the `{nf}' prefix (or any other curly-brace prefix)
       to be specified _after_ the instruction mnemonic. Spaces around
       curly-brace prefixes are optional:

            {nf} add rax, rbx       ; Standard syntax 
            {nf}add  rax, rbx       ; Prefix without space 
            add {nf} rax, rbx       ; Suffix syntax 
            add{nf}  rax, rbx       ; Suffix without space

 4.6.4 Zero Upper (ZU)

       The `{zu}' prefix can be used meaning - "zero-upper", which disables
       retaining the upper parts of the registers and instead zero-extends
       the value into the full 64-bit register when the operand size is 8
       or 16 bits (this is always done when the operand size is 32 bits,
       even without APX). For example:

            {zu} setb al

       ... zeroes out bits [63:8] of the `RAX' register. For this specific
       instruction, NASM also eccepts these alternate syntaxes:

            {zu} setb ax 
            setb {zu} al 
            setb {zu} ax 
            setb {zu} eax 
            setb {zu} rax 
            setb eax 
            setb rax

 4.6.5 Source Condition Code (S_cc_) and Default Flags Value (DFV)

       The source condition code (S_cc_) instructions, `CCMPS'_cc_ and
       `CTESTS'`cc', perform a test which if successful set the arithmetic
       flags to a user specfied value and otherwise leave them unchanged.

       NASM allows the resulting _default flags value_ to be specified
       either using the `{dfv=}'...`}' syntax, containing a comma-separated
       list of zero or more of the CPU flags `OF', `SF', `ZF' or `CF' or
       simply as a numeric immediate (with `OF', `SF', `ZF' and `CF' being
       represented by bits 3 to 0 in that order.)

       The `PF' flag is always set to the same value as the `CF' flag, and
       the `AF' flag is always cleared. NASM allows `{dfv=pf}' as an alias
       for `{dfv=cf}', but do note that it still affects both flags.

       NASM allows, but does not require, a comma after the `{dfv=}' value;
       when using the immediate syntax a comma is required; these examples
       all produce the same instruction:

            ccmpl {dfv=of,cf} rdx, r30 
            ccmpl {dfv=of,cf}, rdx, r30 
            ccmpl 0x9, rdx, r30                     ; Comma required

       The immediate syntax also allows for the `{dfv=}' values to be
       stored in a symbol, or having arithmetic done on them. Note that
       when used in an expression, or in contexts other than `EQU' or one
       of the `S'_cc_ instructions, parenteses are required; this is a
       safety measure (programmer needs to explicitly indicate that use as
       an expression is what is intended):

            ccmpl ({dfv=of}|{dfv=cf}), rdx, r30     ; Parens, comma required 
       ocf1 equ {dfv=of,cf}                         ; Parens not required 
            ccmpl ocf1, rdx, r30                    ; Comma required 
       ofcf equ ({dfv=of,sf,cf} & ~{dfv=sf})        ; Parens required 
            ccmpl ofcf2, rdx, r30                   ; Comma required

 4.6.6 `PUSH' and `POP' Extensions

       APX adds variations of the `PUSH' and `POP' instructions that:

       (*) informs the CPU that a specific `PUSH' and `POP' constitute a
           matched pair, allowing the hardware to optimize for this common
           use case: `PUSHP' and `POPP';

       (*) operates on two registers at the same time: `PUSH2' and `POP2',
           with paired variants `PUSH2P' and `POP2P'.

       These extensions only apply to register forms; they are not
       supported for memory or immediate operands.

       The standard syntax for (`P')`PUSH2' and (`P')`POP2' specify the
       registers in the order they are to be pushed and popped on the
       stack:

            push2p rax, rbx 
            ; rax in [rsp+8] 
            ; rbx is [rsp+0] 
            pop2p rbx, rax

       ... would be the equivalent of:

            push rax 
            push rbx 
            ; rax in [rsp+8] 
            ; rbx is [rsp+0] 
            pop rbx 
            pop rax

       NASM also allows the registers to be specified as a _register pair_
       separated by a colon, in which case the order is always specified in
       the order _high_`:'_low_ and thus is the same for `PUSH2' and
       `POP2'. This means the order of the operands in the `POP2'
       instruction is different:

            push2p rax:rbx 
            ; rax in [rsp+8] 
            ; rbx is [rsp+0] 
            pop2p rax:rbx

 4.6.7 APX and the NASM optimizer

       When the optimizer is enabled (see section 2.1.24), NASM may apply a
       number of optimizations, some of which may apply non-APX
       instructions to what otherwise would be APX forms. Some examples
       are:

       (*) The `{nf}' prefix may be ignored on instructions that already
           don't modify the arithmetic flags.

       (*) When the `{nf}' prefix is specified, NASM may generate another
           instruction which would not modify the flags register. For
           example, `{nf} ror rax, rcx, 3' can be translated into
           `rorx rax, rcx, 3'.

       (*) The `{zu}' prefix may be ignored on instruction that already
           zero the upper parts of the destination register.

       (*) When the `{zu}' prefix is specified, NASM may generate another
           instruction which would zero the upper part of the register. For
           example, `{zu} mov ax, cs' can be translated into `mov eax, cs'.

       (*) New data destination or nondestructive source operands may be
           contracted if they are the same (and the semantics are otherwise
           identical). For example, `add eax, eax, edx' could be encoded as
           `add eax, edx' using legacy encoding. _NASM does not perform
           this optimization as of version 3.00, but it probably will in
           the future._

 4.6.8 Force APX Encoding

       APX encoding, using REX2 and EVEX, respectively, can be forced by
       using the `{rex2}' or `{evex}' instruction prefixes.

Chapter 5: The NASM Preprocessor
--------------------------------

       NASM contains a powerful macro processor, which supports conditional
       assembly, multi-level file inclusion, two forms of macro (single-
       line and multi-line), and a `context stack' mechanism for extra
       macro power. Preprocessor directives all begin with a `%' sign. As a
       result, some care needs to be taken when using the `%' arithmetic
       operator to avoid it being confused with a preprocessor directive;
       it is recommended that it always be surrounded by whitespace.

       The NASM preprocessor borrows concepts from both the C preprocessor
       and the macro facilities of many other assemblers.

   5.1 Preprocessor Expansions

       The input to the preprocessor is expanded in the following ways in
       the order specified here.

 5.1.1 Continuation Line Collapsing

       The preprocessor first collapses all lines which end with a
       backslash (`\') character into a single line. Thus:

       %define THIS_VERY_LONG_MACRO_NAME_IS_DEFINED_TO \ 
               THIS_VALUE

       will work like a single-line macro without the backslash-newline
       sequence.

 5.1.2 Comment Removal

       After concatenation, comments are removed. Comments begin with the
       character `;' unless contained inside a quoted string or a handful
       of other special contexts.

       Note that this is applied _after_ continuation lines are collapsed.
       This means that

             add al,'\'     ; Add the ASCII code for \ 
             mov [ecx],al   ; Save the character

       will probably not do what you expect, as the second line will be
       considered part of the preceeding comment. Although this behavior is
       sometimes confusing, it is both the behavior of NASM since the very
       first version as well as the behavior of the C preprocessor.

 5.1.3 `%line' directives

       In this step, `%line' directives are processed. See section 5.13.1.

 5.1.4  Conditionals, Loops and Multi-Line Macro Definitions

       In this step, the following preprocessor directives are processed:

       (*) Multi-line macro definitions, specified by the `%macro' and
           `%imacro' directives. The body of a multi-line macro is stored
           and is not further expanded at this time. See section 5.5.

       (*) Conditional assembly, specified by the `%if' family of
           preprocessor directives. Disabled part of the source code are
           discarded and are not futher expanded. See section 5.6.

       (*) Preprocessor loops, specified by the `%rep' preprocessor
           directive. A preprocessor loop is very similar to a multi-line
           macro and as such the body is stored and is not futher expanded
           at this time. See section 5.7.

       These constructs are required to be balanced, so that the ending of
       a block can be detected, but no further processing is done at this
       time; stored blocks will be inserted at this step when they are
       expanded (see below.)

       It is specific to each directive to what extent inline expansions
       and detokenization are performed for the arguments of the
       directives.

 5.1.5 Directives processing

       Remaining preprocessor directives are processed. It is specific to
       each directive to what extend the above expansions or the ones
       specified in section 5.1.8 are performed on their arguments.

       It is specific to each directive to what extent inline expansions
       and detokenization are performed for the arguments of the
       directives.

 5.1.6 Inline expansions and other directives

       In this step, the following expansions are performed on each line:

       (*) Single-line macros are expanded. See section 5.2.

       (*) Preprocessor functions are expanded. See section 5.4.

       (*) If this line is the result of multi-line macro expansions (see
           below), the parameters to that macro are expanded at this time.
           See section 5.5.

       (*) Macro indirection, using the `%['...`]' construct, is expanded.
           See section 5.2.3.

       (*) Token concatenation using either the `%+' operator (see section
           5.2.4) or implicitly (see section 5.2.3 and section 5.5.9.)

       (*) Macro-local labels are converted into unique strings, see
           section 5.5.2.

 5.1.7 Multi-Line Macro Expansion

       In this step, multi-line macros are expanded into new lines of
       source, like the typical macro feature of many other assemblers. See
       section 5.5.

       After expansion, the newly injected lines of source are processed
       starting with the step defined in section 5.1.4.

 5.1.8 Detokenization

       In this step, the final line of source code is produced. It performs
       the following operations:

       (*) Environment variables specified using the `%!' construct are
           expanded. See section 5.9.2.

       (*) Context-local labels are expanded into unique strings. See
           section 5.9.2.

       (*) All tokens are converted to their text representation. Unlike
           the C preprocessor, the NASM preprocessor does not insert
           whitespace between adjacent tokens unless present in the source
           code. See section 5.5.9.

       The resulting line of text either is sent to the assembler, or, if
       running in preprocessor-only mode, to the output file (see section
       2.1.22); if necessary prefixed by a newly inserted `%line'
       directive.

   5.2 Single-Line Macros

       Single-line macros are expanded inline, much like macros in the C
       preprocessor.

 5.2.1 The Normal Way: `%define'

       Single-line macros are defined using the `%define' preprocessor
       directive. The definitions work in a similar way to C; so you can do
       things like

       %define ctrl    0x1F & 
       %define param(a,b) ((a)+(a)*(b)) 
       
               mov     byte [param(2,ebx)], ctrl 'D'

       which will expand to

               mov     byte [(2)+(2)*(ebx)], 0x1F & 'D'

       When the expansion of a single-line macro contains tokens which
       invoke another macro, the expansion is performed at invocation time,
       not at definition time. Thus the code

       %define a(x)    1+b(x) 
       %define b(x)    2*x 
       
               mov     ax,a(8)

       will evaluate in the expected way to `mov ax,1+2*8', even though the
       macro `b' wasn't defined at the time of definition of `a'.

       Note that single-line macro argument list cannot be preceded by
       whitespace. Otherwise it will be treated as an expansion. For
       example:

          %define foo (a,b)               ; no arguments, (a,b) is the expansion 
          %define bar(a,b)                ; two arguments, empty expansion

       Macros defined with `%define' are case sensitive: after
       `%define foo bar', only `foo' will expand to `bar': `Foo' or `FOO'
       will not. By using `%idefine' instead of `%define' (the `i' stands
       for `insensitive') you can define all the case variants of a macro
       at once, so that `%idefine foo bar' would cause `foo', `Foo', `FOO',
       `fOO' and so on all to expand to `bar'.

       There is a mechanism which detects when a macro call has occurred as
       a result of a previous expansion of the same macro, to guard against
       circular references and infinite loops. If this happens, the
       preprocessor will only expand the first occurrence of the macro.
       Hence, if you code

       %define a(x)    1+a(x) 
       
               mov     ax,a(3)

       the macro `a(3)' will expand once, becoming `1+a(3)', and will then
       expand no further. This behaviour can be useful: see section 11.1
       for an example of its use.

       You can overload single-line macros: if you write

       %define foo(x)   1+x 
       %define foo(x,y) 1+x*y

       the preprocessor will be able to handle both types of macro call, by
       counting the parameters you pass; so `foo(3)' will become `1+3'
       whereas `foo(ebx,2)' will become `1+ebx*2'. However, if you define

       %define foo bar

       then no other definition of `foo' will be accepted: a macro with no
       parameters prohibits the definition of the same name as a macro
       _with_ parameters, and vice versa.

       This doesn't prevent single-line macros being _redefined_: you can
       perfectly well define a macro with

       %define foo bar

       and then re-define it later in the same source file with

       %define foo baz

       Then everywhere the macro `foo' is invoked, it will be expanded
       according to the most recent definition. This is particularly useful
       when defining single-line macros with `%assign' (see section 5.2.8).

       The following additional features were added in NASM 2.15:

       It is possible to define an empty string instead of an argument name
       if the argument is never used. For example:

          %define ereg(foo,) e %+ foo 
            mov eax,ereg(dx,cx)

       A single pair of parentheses is a subcase of a single, unused
       argument:

          %define myreg() eax 
            mov edx,myreg()

       This is similar to the behavior of the C preprocessor.

       (*) If declared with an `=', NASM will expand the argument and then
           evaluate it as a numeric expression. The name of the argument
           may optionally be followed by `/' followed by a numeric radix
           character (`b', `y', `o', `q', `d', `t', `h' or `x') and/or the
           letters `u' (unsigned) or `s' (signed), in which the number is
           formatted accordingly, with a radix prefix if a radix letter is
           specified. For the case of hexadecimal, if the radix letter is
           in upper case, alphabetic hex digits will be in upper case.

       (*) If declared with an `&', NASM will expand the argument and then
           turn into a quoted string; if the argument already _is_ a quoted
           string, it will be quoted again.

       (*) If declared with `&&', NASM will expand the argument and then
           turn it into a quoted string, but if the argument already is a
           quoted string, it will _not_ be re-quoted.

       (*) If declared with a `+', it is a greedy or variadic parameter; it
           will include any subsequent commas and parameters.

       (*) If declared with an `!', NASM will not strip whitespace and
           braces (potentially useful in conjunction with `&' or `&&'.)

       For example:

           %define xyzzy(=expr,&val,=hex/x) expr, str, hex 
           %define plugh(x) xyzzy(x,x,x) 
           db plugh(13+5), `\0` ; Expands to: db 18, "13+5", 0x12, `\0`

       You can pre-define single-line macros using the `-d' option on the

 5.2.2 Resolving `%define': `%xdefine'

       To have a reference to an embedded single-line macro resolved at the
       time that the embedding macro is _defined_, as opposed to when the
       embedding macro is _expanded_, you need a different mechanism to the
       one offered by `%define'. The solution is to use `%xdefine', or it's
       case-insensitive counterpart `%ixdefine'.

       Suppose you have the following code:

       %define  isTrue  1 
       %define  isFalse isTrue 
       %define  isTrue  0 
       
       val1:    db      isFalse 
       
       %define  isTrue  1 
       
       val2:    db      isFalse

       In this case, `val1' is equal to 0, and `val2' is equal to 1. This
       is because, when a single-line macro is defined using `%define', it
       is expanded only when it is called. As `isFalse' expands to
       `isTrue', the expansion will be the current value of `isTrue'. The
       first time it is called that is 0, and the second time it is 1.

       If you wanted `isFalse' to expand to the value assigned to the
       embedded macro `isTrue' at the time that `isFalse' was defined, you
       need to change the above code to use `%xdefine'.

       %xdefine isTrue  1 
       %xdefine isFalse isTrue 
       %xdefine isTrue  0 
       
       val1:    db      isFalse 
       
       %xdefine isTrue  1 
       
       val2:    db      isFalse

       Now, each time that `isFalse' is called, it expands to 1, as that is
       what the embedded macro `isTrue' expanded to at the time that
       `isFalse' was defined.

       `%xdefine' and `%ixdefine' supports argument expansion exactly the
       same way that `%define' and `%idefine' does.

 5.2.3 Macro Indirection: `%['...`]'

       The `%[...]' construct can be used to expand macros in contexts
       where macro expansion would otherwise not occur, including in the
       names other macros. For example, if you have a set of macros named
       `Foo16', `Foo32' and `Foo64', you could write:

            mov ax,Foo%[__?BITS?__] ; The Foo value

       to use the builtin macro `__?BITS?__' (see section 6.3) to
       automatically select between them. Similarly, the two statements:

       %xdefine Bar         Quux    ; Expands due to %xdefine 
       %define  Bar         %[Quux] ; Expands due to %[...]

       have, in fact, exactly the same effect.

       `%[...]' concatenates to adjacent tokens in the same way that multi-
       line macro parameters do, see section 5.5.9 for details.

 5.2.4 Concatenating Single Line Macro Tokens: `%+'

       Individual tokens in single line macros can be concatenated, to
       produce longer tokens for later processing. This can be useful if
       there are several similar macros that perform similar functions.

       Please note that a space is required after `%+', in order to
       disambiguate it from the syntax `%+1' used in multiline macros.

       As an example, consider the following:

       %define BDASTART 400h                ; Start of BIOS data area

       struc   tBIOSDA                      ; its structure 
               .COM1addr       RESW    1 
               .COM2addr       RESW    1 
               ; ..and so on 
       endstruc

       Now, if we need to access the elements of tBIOSDA in different
       places, we can end up with:

               mov     ax,BDASTART + tBIOSDA.COM1addr 
               mov     bx,BDASTART + tBIOSDA.COM2addr

       This will become pretty ugly (and tedious) if used in many places,
       and can be reduced in size significantly by using the following
       macro:

       ; Macro to access BIOS variables by their names (from tBDA):

       %define BDA(x)  BDASTART + tBIOSDA. %+ x

       Now the above code can be written as:

               mov     ax,BDA(COM1addr) 
               mov     bx,BDA(COM2addr)

       Using this feature, we can simplify references to a lot of macros
       (and, in turn, reduce typing errors).

 5.2.5 The Macro Name Itself: `%?' and `%??'

       The special symbols `%?' and `%??' can be used to reference the
       macro name itself inside a macro expansion, this is supported for
       both single-and multi-line macros. `%?' refers to the macro name as
       _invoked_, whereas `%??' refers to the macro name as _declared_. The
       two are always the same for case-sensitive macros, but for case-
       insensitive macros, they can differ.

       For example:

       %imacro Foo 0 
               mov %?,%?? 
       %endmacro 
       
               foo 
               FOO

       will expand to:

               mov foo,Foo 
               mov FOO,Foo

       These tokens can be used for single-line macros _if defined outside
       any multi-line macros._ See below.

 5.2.6 The Single-Line Macro Name: `%*?' and `%*??'

       If the tokens `%?' and `%??' are used inside a multi-line macro,
       they are expanded before any directives are processed. As a result,

       %imacro Foo 0 
             %idefine Bar _%? 
             mov BAR,bAr 
       %endmacro 
       
             foo 
             mov eax,bar

       will expand to:

             mov _foo,_foo 
             mov eax,_foo

       which may or may not be what you expected. The tokens `%*?' and
       `%*??' behave like `%?' and `%??' but are only expanded inside
       single-line macros. Thus:

       %imacro Foo 0 
             %idefine Bar _%*? 
             mov BAR,bAr 
       %endmacro 
       
             foo 
             mov eax,bar

       will expand to:

             mov _BAR,_bAr 
             mov eax,_bar

       The `%*?' can be used to make a keyword "disappear", for example in
       case a new instruction has been used as a label in older code. For
       example:

       %idefine pause $%*?                 ; Hide the PAUSE instruction

       `%*?' and `%*??' were introduced in NASM 2.15.04.

 5.2.7 Undefining Single-Line Macros: `%undef'

       Single-line macros can be removed with the `%undef' directive. For
       example, the following sequence:

       %define foo bar 
       %undef  foo 
       
               mov     eax, foo

       will expand to the instruction `mov eax, foo', since after `%undef'
       the macro `foo' is no longer defined.

       Macros that would otherwise be pre-defined can be undefined on the
       command-line using the `-u' option on the NASM command line: see
       section 2.1.21.

 5.2.8 Preprocessor Variables: `%assign'

       An alternative way to define single-line macros is by means of the
       `%assign' command (and its case-insensitive counterpart `%iassign',
       which differs from `%assign' in exactly the same way that `%idefine'
       differs from `%define').

       `%assign' is used to define single-line macros which take no
       parameters and have a numeric value. This value can be specified in
       the form of an expression, and it will be evaluated once, when the
       `%assign' directive is processed.

       Like `%define', macros defined using `%assign' can be re-defined
       later, so you can do things like

       %assign i i+1

       to increment the numeric value of a macro.

       `%assign' is useful for controlling the termination of `%rep'
       preprocessor loops: see section 5.7 for an example of this. Another
       use for `%assign' is given in section 10.4 and section 11.1.

       The expression passed to `%assign' is a critical expression (see
       section 3.8), and must also evaluate to a pure number (rather than a
       relocatable reference such as a code or data address, or anything
       involving a register).

       See also the `%eval()' preprocessor function, section 5.4.7.

 5.2.9 Defining Strings: `%defstr'

       `%defstr', and its case-insensitive counterpart `%idefstr', define
       or redefine a single-line macro without parameters but converts the
       entire right-hand side, after macro expansion, to a quoted string
       before definition.

       For example:

       %defstr test TEST

       is equivalent to

       %define test 'TEST'

       This can be used, for example, with the `%!' construct (see section
       5.13.2):

       %defstr PATH %!PATH          ; The operating system PATH variable

       See also the `%str()' preprocessor function, section 5.4.20.

5.2.10 Defining Tokens: `%deftok'

       `%deftok', and its case-insensitive counterpart `%ideftok', define
       or redefine a single-line macro without parameters but converts the
       second parameter, after string conversion, to a sequence of tokens.

       For example:

       %deftok test 'TEST'

       is equivalent to

       %define test TEST

       See also the `%tok()' preprocessor function, section 5.4.24.

5.2.11 Defining Aliases: `%defalias'

       `%defalias', and its case-insensitive counterpart `%idefalias',
       define an alias to a macro, i.e. equivalent of a symbolic link.

       When used with various macro defining and undefining directives, it
       affects the aliased macro. This functionality is intended for being
       able to rename macros while retaining the legacy names.

       When an alias is defined, but the aliased macro is then undefined,
       the aliases can legitimately point to nonexistent macros.

       The alias can be undefined using the `%undefalias' directive. _All_
       aliases can be undefined using the `%clear defalias' directive. This
       includes backwards compatibility aliases defined by NASM itself.

       To disable aliases without undefining them, use the `%aliases off'
       directive.

       To check whether an alias is defined, regardless of the existence of
       the aliased macro, use `%ifdefalias'.

       For example:

       %defalias OLD NEW 
          ; OLD and NEW both undefined 
       %define NEW 123 
          ; OLD and NEW both 123 
       %undef OLD 
          ; OLD and NEW both undefined 
       %define OLD 456 
          ; OLD and NEW both 456 
       %undefalias OLD 
          ; OLD undefined, NEW defined to 456

5.2.12 Conditional Comma Operator: `%,'

       As of version 2.15, NASM has a conditional comma operator `%,' that
       expands to a comma _unless_ followed by a null expansion, which
       allows suppressing the comma before an empty argument. This is
       especially useful with greedy single-line macros.

       For example, all the expressions below are valid:

       %define greedy(a,b,c+) a + 66 %, b * 3 %, c 
       
              db greedy(1,2)          ; db 1 + 66, 2 * 3 
              db greedy(1,2,3)        ; db 1 + 66, 2 * 3, 3 
              db greedy(1,2,3,4)      ; db 1 + 66, 2 * 3, 3, 4 
              db greedy(1,2,3,4,5)    ; db 1 + 66, 2 * 3, 3, 4, 5

   5.3 String Manipulation in Macros

       It's often useful to be able to handle strings in macros. NASM
       supports a few simple string handling macro operators from which
       more complex operations can be constructed.

       All the string operators define or redefine a single-line macro to
       some value (either a string or a numeric value). When producing a
       string value, it may change the style of quoting of the input string
       or strings, and possibly use `\'-escapes inside ``'-quoted strings.

       These directives are also available as preprocessor functions, see
       section 5.4.

 5.3.1 Concatenating Strings: `%strcat'

       The `%strcat' operator concatenates quoted strings and assign them
       to a single-line macro.

       For example:

       %strcat alpha "Alpha: ", '12" screen'

       ... would assign the value `'Alpha: 12" screen'' to `alpha'.
       Similarly:

       %strcat beta '"foo"\', "'bar'"

       ... would assign the value ``"foo"\\'bar'`' to `beta'.

       The use of commas to separate strings is permitted but optional.

       The corresponding preprocessor function is `%strcat()', see section
       5.4.21.

 5.3.2 String Length: `%strlen'

       The `%strlen' operator assigns the length of a string to a macro.
       For example:

       %strlen charcnt 'my string'

       In this example, `charcnt' would receive the value 9, just as if an
       `%assign' had been used. In this example, `'my string'' was a
       literal string but it could also have been a single-line macro that
       expands to a string, as in the following example:

       %define sometext 'my string' 
       %strlen charcnt sometext

       As in the first case, this would result in `charcnt' being assigned
       the value of 9.

       The corresponding preprocessor function is `%strlen()', see section
       5.4.22.

 5.3.3 Extracting Substrings: `%substr'

       Individual letters or substrings in strings can be extracted using
       the `%substr' operator. An example of its use is probably more
       useful than the description:

       %substr mychar 'xyzw' 1       ; equivalent to %define mychar 'x' 
       %substr mychar 'xyzw' 2       ; equivalent to %define mychar 'y' 
       %substr mychar 'xyzw' 3       ; equivalent to %define mychar 'z' 
       %substr mychar 'xyzw' 2,2     ; equivalent to %define mychar 'yz' 
       %substr mychar 'xyzw' 2,-1    ; equivalent to %define mychar 'yzw' 
       %substr mychar 'xyzw' 2,-2    ; equivalent to %define mychar 'yz'

       As with `%strlen' (see section 5.3.2), the first parameter is the
       single-line macro to be created and the second is the string. The
       third parameter specifies the first character to be selected, and
       the optional fourth parameter (preceded by comma) is the length.
       Note that the first index is 1, not 0 and the last index is equal to
       the value that `%strlen' would assign given the same string. Index
       values out of range result in an empty string. A negative length
       means "until N-1 characters before the end of string", i.e. `-1'
       means until end of string, `-2' until one character before, etc.

       The corresponding preprocessor function is `%substr()', see section
       5.4.23, however please note that the default value for the length
       parameter, if omitted, is `-1' rather than `1' for `%substr()'.

   5.4 Preprocessor Functions

       Preprocessor functions are, fundamentally, a kind of built-in
       single-line macros. They expand to a string depending on its
       arguments, and can be used in any context where single-line macro
       expansion would be performed. Preprocessor functions were introduced
       in NASM 2.16.

       Starting with NASM 3.00, the `%ifdef' directive or `%isdef()'
       function can also test for the availability of preprocessor
       functions. They cannot, however, be undefined, aliased or redefined.

 5.4.1 `%abs()' Function

       The `%abs()' function evaluates its first argument as an expression,
       and then emits the absolute value. This will always be emitted as a
       single token containing a decimal number; no minus sign will be
       emitted even if the input value is the maximum negative number.

 5.4.2 `%b2hs()' Function

       The `%b2hs()' functin takes a quoted string and an optional
       separator string, and expands to a quoted string containing a packed
       hexadecimal form of the bytes of the first string, separated by the
       separator string if applicable. This is the inverse of the `%hs2b()'
       function, see section 5.4.10.

 5.4.3 `%chr()' Function

       The `%chr()' function evaluates its arguments as integers, then
       creates a quoted string out of these integers (mod 256) as bytes.

 5.4.4 `%cond()' Function

       The `%cond()' function evaluates its first argument as an
       expression, then expands to its second argument if true (nonzero),
       and the third, if present, if false (zero). This is in effect a
       specialized version of the `%sel()' function; `%cond(x,y,z)' is
       equivalent to `%sel(1+!(x),y,z)'.

       %define a 1 
       %xdefine astr %cond(a,"true","false") ; %define astr "true"

       The argument not selected is never expanded.

 5.4.5 `%count()' Function

       The `%count()' function expands to the number of argments passed to
       the macro. Note that just as for single-line macros, `%count()'
       treats an empty argument list as a single empty argument.

       %xdefine empty %count()        ; %define empty 1 
       %xdefine one   %count(1)       ; %define one 1 
       %xdefine two   %count(5,q)     ; %define two 2 
       %define  list  a,b,46 
       %xdefine lc1   %count(list)    ; %define lc 1 (just one argument) 
       %xdefine lc2   %count(%[list]) ; %define lc 3 (indirection expands)

 5.4.6 `%depend()' Function

       he `%depend()' function takes a quoted string as argument, adds it
       to the output dependency list generated by the `-M' options (see
       section 2.1.5), and evaluates to the unchanged string.

       This is the function equivalent of the `%depend' directive, see
       section 5.8.3.

       See also the `%pathsearch()' function (section 5.4.16).

 5.4.7 `%eval()' Function

       The `%eval()' function evaluates its argument as a numeric
       expression and expands to the result as an integer constant in much
       the same way the `%assign' directive would, see section 5.2.8.
       Unlike `%assign', `%eval()' supports more than one argument; if more
       than one argument is specified, it is expanded to a comma-separated
       list of values.

       %assign a    2 
       %assign b    3 
       %defstr what %eval(a+b,a*b)  ; equivalent to %define what "5,6"

       The expressions passed to `%eval()' are critical expressions, see
       section 3.8.

 5.4.8 `%find()' and `%findi()' Functions

       The `%find()' and `%findi()' functions take an argument followed by
       an optional list. These are turned into quoted strings if necessary,
       and then compared as if by the `%isidn()' or `%isidni()' functions,
       respectively (see section 5.6.6) - the `%find()' function compares
       case sensitively, and `%findi()' case insensitively.

       The functions then expand to `0' if none of the strings in the list
       match the first string, or the position in the list where the first
       string was found, where `1' is the first argument in the list, i.e.
       not including the first argument to the function.

       Once a matching argument has been found, no further arguments are
       expanded.

       For example:

            db %find(a,b,c,d)                       ; 0 
            db %find(a,b,a,c)                       ; 2 
            db %find(a)                             ; 0 (empty list)

 5.4.9 `%hex()' Function

       Equivalent to `%eval()', except that the results generated are given
       as unsigned hexadecimal, with a `0x' prefix.

5.4.10 `%hs2b()' Function

       The `%hs2b()' function takes one or more quoted strings containing
       hexadecimal numbers and optional separators (any character that is
       not a valid hexadecimal digit is considered a separator) and expands
       to a quoted string containing the bytes encoded in the hexadecimal
       string. Every pair of hexadecimal digits encodes a byte, but a
       separator will always terminate the encoding of a byte. Thus, these
       two statements will produce the same output:

            db 0x00, 0x01, 0x02, 0x03, 0x04, 0x05, 0x06, 0x07, 0x08, 0x09 
            db %hs2b("00010203 4 0506 07 8","9")

       This can be used to compactly encode long strings of binary data in
       source code.

5.4.11 `%is()' Family Functions

       Each `%if' conditional assembly family directive (see section 5.6)
       has an equivalent `%is()' family function, that expands to `1' if
       the equivalent `%if' directive would process as true, and `0' if the
       equivalent `%if' directive would process as false.

       This includes the `%ifn' forms of these directives, which become
       `%isn()'.

       ; Instead of !%isidn() could have used %isnidn() 
       %if %isdef(foo) && !%isidn(foo,bar) 
             db "foo is defined, but not as 'bar'" 
       %endif

       Note that, being functions, the arguments (before expansion) will
       always need to have balanced parentheses so that the end of the
       argument list can be defined. This means that the syntax of e.g.
       `%istoken()' and `%isidn()' is somewhat stricter than their
       corresponding `%if' directives; it may be necessary to escape the
       argument to the conditional using `{}':

       ; Instead of !%isidn() could have used %isnidn() 
       %if %isdef(foo) && !%isidn({foo,)}) 
             db "foo is defined, but not as ')'" 
       %endif

       Unlike the C `defined()' preprocessor construct, these functions are
       valid anywhere in the source code, not just in `%if' expressions.

5.4.12 `%map()' Function

       The `%map()' function takes as its first parameter the name of a
       single-line macro, followed by up to two optional colon-separated
       subparameters:

       (*) The first subparameter, if present, should be a list of macro
           parameters enclosed in parentheses. Note that `()' represents a
           one-argument list containing an empty parameter; omit the
           parentheses to specify no parameters.

       (*) The second subparameter, if present, represent the number of
           group size for additional parameters to the macro (default 1).

       Further parameters, if any, are then passed as additional parameters
       to the given macro for expansion, in sets given by the specified
       group size, and the results turned into a comma-separated list. If
       no additional parameters are given, `%map()' expands to nothing.

       For example:

       %define alpha(&x)     x 
       %define alpha(&x,y)   y dup (x) 
       %define alpha(s,&x,y) y dup (x,s) 
       ; 0 fixed + 1 grouped parameters per call, calls alpha(&x) 
             db %map(alpha,foo,bar,baz,quux) 
       ; 0 fixed + 2 grouped parameters per call, calls alpha(&x,y) 
             db %map(alpha::2,foo,bar,baz,quux) 
       ; 1 fixed + 2 grouped parameters per call, calls alpha(s,&x,y) 
             db %map(alpha:("!"):2,foo,bar,baz,quux)

       ... expands to:

             db 'foo','bar','baz','quux' 
             db bar dup ('foo'),quux dup ('baz') 
             db bar dup ('foo',"!"),quux dup ('baz',"!")

       As a more complex example, a macro that joins quoted strings
       together with a user-specified delimiter string:

       %define join(sep)        ''      ; handle the case of zero strings 
       %define _join(sep,str)   sep,str ; helper macro 
       %define join(sep,s1,sn+) %strcat(s1, %map(_join:(sep) %, sn)) 
       
             db join(':') 
             db join(':','a') 
             db join(':','a','b') 
             db join(':','a','b','c') 
             db join(':','a','b','c','d')

       ... expands to:

             db '' 
             db 'a' 
             db 'a:b' 
             db 'a:b:c' 
             db 'a:b:c:d'

5.4.13 `%null()' Function

       The `%null()' function ignores its arguments without expanding them,
       and expands to nothing.

5.4.14 `%num()' Function

       The `%num()' function evaluates its arguments as expressions, and
       then produces a quoted string encoding the first argument as an
       _unsigned_ 64-bit integer.

       The second argument is the desired number of digits (max 255,
       default -1).

       The third argument is the encoding base (from 2 to 64, default 10);
       if the base is given as -2, -8, -10, or -16, then `0b', `0q', `0d'
       or `0x' is prepended, respectively; all other negative values are
       disallowed.

       Only the first argument is required.

       If the number of digits is negative, NASM will add additional digits
       if needed; if positive the string is truncated to the number of
       digits specified. 0 is treated as -1, except that the input number 0
       always generates an empty string (thus, the first digit will never
       be zero), even if the base given is negative.

       The full 64-symbol set used is, in order:

       0123456789abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ@_

       If a _signed_ number needs to be converted to a string, use
       `%abs()', `%cond()', and `%strcat()' to format the signed number
       string to your specific output requirements.

5.4.15 `%ord()' Function

       The `%ord()' function takes a quoted string, and (like `%substr()',
       see section 5.4.23) an optional starting index and length, and
       expands to a comma-separated list of integers corresponding to the
       bytes of the quoted string. Note that unlike `%substr()' the length
       argument defaults to `1', so if it is not given only a single byte
       value is expanded.

5.4.16 `%pathsearch()' Function

       The `%pathsearch()' function takes a quoted string as argument, and
       searches for a file with that name in the include path, then expands
       to the pathname located, if found, otherwise to the unmodified
       string.

       This is the function equivalent of the `%pathsearch' directive, see
       section 5.8.2.

       See also the `%depend()' function (section 5.4.6).

5.4.17 `%realpath()' Function

       The `%realpath()' function takes a quoted string as argument, and
       attempts to convert it to a fully qualified absolute path name if
       supported by the underlying host operating system.

       If successful, it expands to a quoted string with the resulting path
       name, otherwise to the unmodified string.

       The include path is _not_ searched; to search for the file using the
       include path, use the `%pathsearch()' function in conjunction with
       this function, for example:

       %define SOMEREALPATH %realpath(%pathsearch("somefile.asm"))

5.4.18 `%sel()' Function

       The `%sel()' function evaluates its first argument as an expression,
       then expands to its second argument if 1, the third argument if 2,
       and so on. If the value is less than 1 or larger than the number of
       arguments minus one, then the `%sel()' function expands to nothing.

       %define b 2 
       %xdefine bstr %sel(b,"one","two","three") ; %define bstr "two"

       The arguments not selected are never expanded.

5.4.19 `%selbits()' Function

       The `%selbits()' function returns its first, second, or third
       argument depending on if the current mode is 16, 32 or 64 bits. If
       less than three arguments are given, the last argument is considered
       repeated. Like `%cond()', this is a specialized version of the
       `%sel()' function.

       For example:

            BITS 64 
       
       %define breg %selbits(bx,ebx,rbx) 
       %define vreg %selbits(ax,eax) 
       
            mov vreg,[breg]         ; mov eax,[rbx]

5.4.20 `%str()' Function

       The `%str()' function converts its argument, including any commas,
       to a quoted string, similar to the way the `%defstr' directive
       would, see section 5.2.9.

       Being a function, the argument will need to have balanced
       parentheses or be escaped using `{}'.

       ; The following lines are all equivalent 
       %define  test 'TEST' 
       %defstr  test TEST 
       %xdefine test %str(TEST)

5.4.21 `%strcat()' Function

       The `%strcat()' function concatenates a list of quoted strings, in
       the same way the `%strcat' directive would, see section 5.3.1.

       ; The following lines are all equivalent 
       %define  alpha 'Alpha: 12" screen' 
       %strcat  alpha "Alpha: ", '12" screen' 
       %xdefine alpha %strcat("Alpha: ", '12" screen')

5.4.22 `%strlen()' Function

       The `%strlen()' function expands to the length of a quoted string,
       in the same way the `%strlen' directive would, see section 5.3.2.

       ; The following lines are all equivalent 
       %define  charcnt 9 
       %strlen  charcnt 'my string' 
       %xdefine charcnt %strlen('my string')

5.4.23 `%substr()' Function

       The `%substr()' function extracts a substring of a quoted string, in
       the same way the `%substr' directive would, see section 5.3.3. Note
       that unlike the `%substr' directive, commas are required between all
       parameters, is required after the string argument, and that the
       default for the length argument, if omitted, is `-1' (i.e. the
       remainder of the string) rather than `1'.

       ; The following lines are all equivalent 
       %define  mychar 'yzw' 
       %substr  mychar 'xyzw' 2,-1 
       %xdefine mychar %substr('xyzw',2,3) 
       %xdefine mychar %substr('xyzw',2,-1) 
       %xdefine mychar %substr('xyzw',2)

5.4.24 `%tok()' function

       The `%tok()' function converts a quoted string into a sequence of
       tokens, in the same way the `%deftok' directive would, see section
       5.2.10.

       ; The following lines are all equivalent 
       %define test TEST 
       %deftok test 'TEST' 
       %define test %tok('TEST')

   5.5 Multi-Line Macros: `%macro'

       Multi-line macros much like the type of macro seen in MASM and TASM,
       and expand to a new set of lines of source code. A multi-line macro
       definition in NASM looks something like this.

       %macro  prologue 1 
       
               push    ebp 
               mov     ebp,esp 
               sub     esp,%1 
       
       %endmacro

       This defines a C-like function prologue as a macro: so you would
       invoke the macro with a call such as:

       myfunc:   prologue 12

       which would expand to the three lines of code

       myfunc: push    ebp 
               mov     ebp,esp 
               sub     esp,12

       The number `1' after the macro name in the `%macro' line defines the
       number of parameters the macro `prologue' expects to receive. The
       use of `%1' inside the macro definition refers to the first
       parameter to the macro call. With a macro taking more than one
       parameter, subsequent parameters would be referred to as `%2', `%3'
       and so on.

       Multi-line macros, like single-line macros, are case-sensitive,
       unless you define them using the alternative directive `%imacro'.

       If you need to pass a comma as _part_ of a parameter to a multi-line
       macro, you can do that by enclosing the entire parameter in braces.
       So you could code things like:

       %macro  silly 2 
       
           %2: db      %1 
       
       %endmacro 
       
               silly 'a', letter_a             ; letter_a:  db 'a' 
               silly 'ab', string_ab           ; string_ab: db 'ab' 
               silly {13,10}, crlf             ; crlf:      db 13,10

       The behavior with regards to empty arguments at the end of multi-
       line macros before NASM 2.15 was often very strange. For backwards
       compatibility, NASM attempts to recognize cases where the legacy
       behavior would give unexpected results, and issues a warning, but
       largely tries to match the legacy behavior. This can be disabled
       with the `%pragma' (see section 5.12.1):

       %pragma preproc sane_empty_expansion

 5.5.1 Overloading Multi-Line Macros

       As with single-line macros, multi-line macros can be overloaded by
       defining the same macro name several times with different numbers of
       parameters. This time, no exception is made for macros with no
       parameters at all. So you could define

       %macro  prologue 0 
       
               push    ebp 
               mov     ebp,esp 
       
       %endmacro

       to define an alternative form of the function prologue which
       allocates no local stack space.

       Sometimes, however, you might want to `overload' a machine
       instruction; for example, you might want to define

       %macro  push 2 
       
               push    %1 
               push    %2 
       
       %endmacro

       so that you could code

               push    ebx             ; this line is not a macro call 
               push    eax,ecx         ; but this one is

       Ordinarily, NASM will give a warning for the first of the above two
       lines, since `push' is now defined to be a macro, and is being
       invoked with a number of parameters for which no definition has been
       given. The correct code will still be generated, but the assembler
       will give a warning. This warning can be disabled by the use of the
       `-w-macro-params' command-line option (see section 2.1.26).

 5.5.2 Macro-Local Labels

       NASM allows you to define labels within a multi-line macro
       definition in such a way as to make them local to the macro call: so
       calling the same macro multiple times will use a different label
       each time. You do this by prefixing `%%' to the label name. So you
       can invent an instruction which executes a `RET' if the `Z' flag is
       set by doing this:

       %macro  retz 0 
       
               jnz     %%skip 
               ret 
           %%skip: 
       
       %endmacro

       You can call this macro as many times as you want, and every time
       you call it NASM will make up a different `real' name to substitute
       for the label `%%skip'. The names NASM invents are of the form
       `..@2345.skip', where the number 2345 changes with every macro call.
       The `..@' prefix prevents macro-local labels from interfering with
       the local label mechanism, as described in section 3.9. You should
       avoid defining your own labels in this form (the `..@' prefix, then
       a number, then another period) in case they interfere with macro-
       local labels.

       These labels are really macro-local _tokens_, and can be used for
       other purposes where a token unique to each macro invocation is
       desired, e.g. to name single-line macros without using the context
       feature (section 5.9.2).

 5.5.3 Greedy Macro Parameters

       Occasionally it is useful to define a macro which lumps its entire
       command line into one parameter definition, possibly after
       extracting one or two smaller parameters from the front. An example
       might be a macro to write a text string to a file in MS-DOS, where
       you might want to be able to write

               writefile [filehandle],"hello, world",13,10

       NASM allows you to define the last parameter of a macro to be
       _greedy_, meaning that if you invoke the macro with more parameters
       than it expects, all the spare parameters get lumped into the last
       defined one along with the separating commas. So if you code:

       %macro  writefile 2+ 
       
               jmp     %%endstr 
         %%str:        db      %2 
         %%endstr: 
               mov     dx,%%str 
               mov     cx,%%endstr-%%str 
               mov     bx,%1 
               mov     ah,0x40 
               int     0x21 
       
       %endmacro

       then the example call to `writefile' above will work as expected:
       the text before the first comma, `[filehandle]', is used as the
       first macro parameter and expanded when `%1' is referred to, and all
       the subsequent text is lumped into `%2' and placed after the `db'.

       The greedy nature of the macro is indicated to NASM by the use of
       the `+' sign after the parameter count on the `%macro' line.

       If you define a greedy macro, you are effectively telling NASM how
       it should expand the macro given _any_ number of parameters from the
       actual number specified up to infinity; in this case, for example,
       NASM now knows what to do when it sees a call to `writefile' with 2,
       3, 4 or more parameters. NASM will take this into account when
       overloading macros, and will not allow you to define another form of
       `writefile' taking 4 parameters (for example).

       Of course, the above macro could have been implemented as a non-
       greedy macro, in which case the call to it would have had to look
       like

                 writefile [filehandle], {"hello, world",13,10}

       NASM provides both mechanisms for putting commas in macro
       parameters, and you choose which one you prefer for each macro
       definition.

       See section 8.3.1 for a better way to write the above macro.

 5.5.4 Macro Parameters Range

       NASM allows you to expand parameters via special construction
       `%{x:y}' where `x' is the first parameter index and `y' is the last.
       Any index can be either negative or positive but must never be zero.

       For example

       %macro mpar 1-* 
            db %{3:5} 
       %endmacro 
       
       mpar 1,2,3,4,5,6

       expands to `3,4,5' range.

       Even more, the parameters can be reversed so that

       %macro mpar 1-* 
            db %{5:3} 
       %endmacro 
       
       mpar 1,2,3,4,5,6

       expands to `5,4,3' range.

       But even this is not the last. The parameters can be addressed via
       negative indices so NASM will count them reversed. The ones who know
       Python may see the analogue here.

       %macro mpar 1-* 
            db %{-1:-3} 
       %endmacro 
       
       mpar 1,2,3,4,5,6

       expands to `6,5,4' range.

       Note that NASM uses comma to separate parameters being expanded.

       By the way, here is a trick - you might use the index `%{-1:-1'}
       which gives you the last argument passed to a macro.

 5.5.5 Default Macro Parameters

       NASM also allows you to define a multi-line macro with a _range_ of
       allowable parameter counts. If you do this, you can specify defaults
       for omitted parameters. So, for example:

       %macro  die 0-1 "Painful program death has occurred." 
       
               writefile 2,%1 
               mov     ax,0x4c01 
               int     0x21 
       
       %endmacro

       This macro (which makes use of the `writefile' macro defined in
       section 5.5.3) can be called with an explicit error message, which
       it will display on the error output stream before exiting, or it can
       be called with no parameters, in which case it will use the default
       error message supplied in the macro definition.

       In general, you supply a minimum and maximum number of parameters
       for a macro of this type; the minimum number of parameters are then
       required in the macro call, and then you provide defaults for the
       optional ones. So if a macro definition began with the line

       %macro foobar 1-3 eax,[ebx+2]

       then it could be called with between one and three parameters, and
       `%1' would always be taken from the macro call. `%2', if not
       specified by the macro call, would default to `eax', and `%3' if not
       specified would default to `[ebx+2]'.

       You can provide extra information to a macro by providing too many
       default parameters:

       %macro quux 1 something

       This will trigger a warning by default; see section 2.1.26 for more
       information. When `quux' is invoked, it receives not one but two
       parameters. `something' can be referred to as `%2'. The difference
       between passing `something' this way and writing `something' in the
       macro body is that with this way `something' is evaluated when the
       macro is defined, not when it is expanded.

       You may omit parameter defaults from the macro definition, in which
       case the parameter default is taken to be blank. This can be useful
       for macros which can take a variable number of parameters, since the
       `%0' token (see section 5.5.6) allows you to determine how many
       parameters were really passed to the macro call.

       This defaulting mechanism can be combined with the greedy-parameter
       mechanism; so the `die' macro above could be made more powerful, and
       more useful, by changing the first line of the definition to

       %macro die 0-1+ "Painful program death has occurred.",13,10

       The maximum parameter count can be infinite, denoted by `*'. In this
       case, of course, it is impossible to provide a _full_ set of default
       parameters. Examples of this usage are shown in section 5.5.8.

 5.5.6 `%0': Macro Parameter Counter

       The parameter reference `%0' will return a numeric constant giving
       the number of parameters received, that is, if `%0' is n then `%'n
       is the last parameter. `%0' is mostly useful for macros that can
       take a variable number of parameters. It can be used as an argument
       to `%rep' (see section 5.7) in order to iterate through all the
       parameters of a macro. Examples are given in section 5.5.8.

 5.5.7 `%00': Label Preceding Macro

       `%00' will return the label preceding the macro invocation, if any.
       The label must be on the same line as the macro invocation, may be a
       local label (see section 3.9), and need not end in a colon.

       If `%00' is present anywhere in the macro body, the label itself
       will not be emitted by NASM. You can, of course, put `%00:'
       explicitly at the beginning of your macro.

 5.5.8 `%rotate': Rotating Macro Parameters

       Unix shell programmers will be familiar with the `shift' shell
       command, which allows the arguments passed to a shell script
       (referenced as `$1', `$2' and so on) to be moved left by one place,
       so that the argument previously referenced as `$2' becomes available
       as `$1', and the argument previously referenced as `$1' is no longer
       available at all.

       NASM provides a similar mechanism, in the form of `%rotate'. As its
       name suggests, it differs from the Unix `shift' in that no
       parameters are lost: parameters rotated off the left end of the
       argument list reappear on the right, and vice versa.

       `%rotate' is invoked with a single numeric argument (which may be an
       expression). The macro parameters are rotated to the left by that
       many places. If the argument to `%rotate' is negative, the macro
       parameters are rotated to the right.

       So a pair of macros to save and restore a set of registers might
       work as follows:

       %macro  multipush 1-* 
       
         %rep  %0 
               push    %1 
         %rotate 1 
         %endrep 
       
       %endmacro

       This macro invokes the `PUSH' instruction on each of its arguments
       in turn, from left to right. It begins by pushing its first
       argument, `%1', then invokes `%rotate' to move all the arguments one
       place to the left, so that the original second argument is now
       available as `%1'. Repeating this procedure as many times as there
       were arguments (achieved by supplying `%0' as the argument to
       `%rep') causes each argument in turn to be pushed.

       Note also the use of `*' as the maximum parameter count, indicating
       that there is no upper limit on the number of parameters you may
       supply to the `multipush' macro.

       It would be convenient, when using this macro, to have a `POP'
       equivalent, which _didn't_ require the arguments to be given in
       reverse order. Ideally, you would write the `multipush' macro call,
       then cut-and-paste the line to where the pop needed to be done, and
       change the name of the called macro to `multipop', and the macro
       would take care of popping the registers in the opposite order from
       the one in which they were pushed.

       This can be done by the following definition:

       %macro  multipop 1-* 
       
         %rep %0 
         %rotate -1 
               pop     %1 
         %endrep 
       
       %endmacro

       This macro begins by rotating its arguments one place to the
       _right_, so that the original _last_ argument appears as `%1'. This
       is then popped, and the arguments are rotated right again, so the
       second-to-last argument becomes `%1'. Thus the arguments are
       iterated through in reverse order.

 5.5.9 Concatenating Macro Parameters

       NASM can concatenate macro parameters and macro indirection
       constructs with other surrounding text. This allows you to declare a
       family of symbols, for example, in a macro definition. If, for
       example, you wanted to generate a table of key codes along with
       offsets into the table, you could code something like

       %macro keytab_entry 2 
       
           keypos%1    equ     $-keytab 
                       db      %2 
       
       %endmacro 
       
       keytab: 
                 keytab_entry F1,128+1 
                 keytab_entry F2,128+2 
                 keytab_entry Return,13

       which would expand to

       keytab: 
       keyposF1        equ     $-keytab 
                       db     128+1 
       keyposF2        equ     $-keytab 
                       db      128+2 
       keyposReturn    equ     $-keytab 
                       db      13

       You can just as easily concatenate text on to the other end of a
       macro parameter, by writing `%1foo'.

       If you need to append a _digit_ to a macro parameter, for example
       defining labels `foo1' and `foo2' when passed the parameter `foo',
       you can't code `%11' because that would be taken as the eleventh
       macro parameter. Instead, you must code `%{1}1', which will separate
       the first `1' (giving the number of the macro parameter) from the
       second (literal text to be concatenated to the parameter).

       This concatenation can also be applied to other preprocessor in-line
       objects, such as macro-local labels (section 5.5.2) and context-
       local labels (section 5.9.2). In all cases, ambiguities in syntax
       can be resolved by enclosing everything after the `%' sign and
       before the literal text in braces: so `%{%foo}bar' concatenates the
       text `bar' to the end of the real name of the macro-local label
       `%%foo'. (This is unnecessary, since the form NASM uses for the real
       names of macro-local labels means that the two usages `%{%foo}bar'
       and `%%foobar' would both expand to the same thing anyway;
       nevertheless, the capability is there.)

       The single-line macro indirection construct, `%[...]' (section
       5.2.3), behaves the same way as macro parameters for the purpose of
       concatenation.

       See also the `%+' operator, section 5.2.4.

5.5.10 Condition Codes as Macro Parameters

       NASM can give special treatment to a macro parameter which contains
       a condition code. For a start, you can refer to the macro parameter
       `%1' by means of the alternative syntax `%+1', which informs NASM
       that this macro parameter is supposed to contain a condition code,
       and will cause the preprocessor to report an error message if the
       macro is called with a parameter which is _not_ a valid condition
       code.

       Far more usefully, though, you can refer to the macro parameter by
       means of `%-1', which NASM will expand as the _inverse_ condition
       code. So the `retz' macro defined in section 5.5.2 can be replaced
       by a general conditional-return macro like this:

       %macro  retc 1 
       
               j%-1    %%skip 
               ret 
         %%skip: 
       
       %endmacro

       This macro can now be invoked using calls like `retc ne', which will
       cause the conditional-jump instruction in the macro expansion to
       come out as `JE', or `retc po' which will make the jump a `JPE'.

       The `%+1' macro-parameter reference is quite happy to interpret the
       arguments `CXZ' and `ECXZ' as valid condition codes; however, `%-1'
       will report an error if passed either of these, because no inverse
       condition code exists.

5.5.11 Disabling Listing Expansion

       When NASM is generating a listing file from your program, it will
       generally expand multi-line macros by means of writing the macro
       call and then listing each line of the expansion. This allows you to
       see which instructions in the macro expansion are generating what
       code; however, for some macros this clutters the listing up
       unnecessarily.

       NASM therefore provides the `.nolist' qualifier, which you can
       include in a macro definition to inhibit the expansion of the macro
       in the listing file. The `.nolist' qualifier comes directly after
       the number of parameters, like this:

       %macro foo 1.nolist

       Or like this:

       %macro bar 1-5+.nolist a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h

5.5.12 Undefining Multi-Line Macros: `%unmacro', `%unimacro'

       Multi-line macros can be removed with the `%unmacro' or `%unimacro'
       directives.

       Unlike the `%undef' directive, however, these directives take an
       argument specification, and will only remove exact matches with that
       argument specification. Furthermore, case sensitive macros have
       match the directive: a case-sensitive macro has to be removed with
       `%unmacro', and a case-insensitive one with `%unimacro'. This
       ensures that only the specific macro intended is removed.

       For example:

       %macro foo 1-3 
               ; Do something 
       %endmacro 
       %unmacro foo 1-3

       removes the previously defined macro `foo', but

       %macro bar 1-3 
               ; Do something 
       %endmacro 
       %unmacro bar 1

       does _not_ remove the macro `bar', since the argument specification
       does not match exactly.

5.5.13 `%exitmacro': Stop Expanding a Multi-Line Macro

       If a `%exitmacro' directive is encountered, NASM will immediately
       stop expanding the current multiline macro. This can, for example,
       be used to avoid unnecessarily deep `%if' trees in the case of error
       conditions, such as:

       %macro count_something 2 
        %if %1 < 0 
          %warning %?: negative count 
          %exitmacro 
        %endif 
        ; ... do the thing, knowing that %1 >= 0 ... 
       %endmacro

       Compare with the `%exitrep' directive, section 5.7.

   5.6 Conditional Assembly

       Similarly to the C preprocessor, NASM allows sections of a source
       file to be assembled only if certain conditions are met. The general
       syntax of this feature looks like this:

       %if<condition> 
           ; some code which only appears if <condition> is met 
       %elif<condition2> 
           ; only appears if <condition> is not met but <condition2> is 
       %else 
           ; this appears if neither <condition> nor <condition2> was met 
       %endif

       The inverse forms `%ifn' and `%elifn' are also supported.

       You can have multiple `%elif' clauses, or none. The `%else' clause
       is likewise optional.

       There are a number of variants of the `%if' directive. Each has its
       corresponding `%elif', `%ifn', and `%elifn' directives; for example,
       the equivalents to the `%ifdef' directive are `%elifdef', `%ifndef',
       and `%elifndef'.

       Futhermore, each variant of the `%if' directive (including `%ifn'
       forms) has a corresponding `%is()' preprocessor function (see
       section 5.4.11.) These are particularly useful for testing multiple
       conditions at the same time. Unlike the C `defined()' preprocessor
       construct, these functions are valid anywhere in the source code,
       not just in `%if' expressions.

       The following descriptions of tests all imply the existence of these
       alternate forms.

 5.6.1 `%if': Testing Arbitrary Numeric Expressions

       The conditional-assembly construct `%if expr' will cause the
       subsequent code to be assembled if and only if the value of the
       numeric expression `expr' is non-zero. An example of the use of this
       feature is in deciding when to break out of a `%rep' preprocessor
       loop: see section 5.7 for a detailed example.

       The expression given to `%if' is a critical expression (see section
       3.8).

 5.6.2 `%ifdef': Testing Single-Line Macro Existence

       Beginning a conditional-assembly block with the line `%ifdef MACRO'
       will assemble the subsequent code if, and only if, a single-line
       macro called `MACRO' is defined.

       For example, when debugging a program, you might want to write code
       such as

                 ; perform some function 
       %ifdef DEBUG 
                 writefile 2,"Function performed successfully",13,10 
       %endif 
                 ; go and do something else

       Then you could use the command-line option `-dDEBUG' to create a
       version of the program which produced debugging messages, and remove
       the option to generate the final release version of the program.

       From NASM 3.00 onward, `%ifdef' can also test for the availability
       of a preprocessor function, for example:

       %ifdef %newfunc 
         db %newfunc(99)     ; Generates something magic 
       %else 
         %warning "This version of NASM doesn't support %newfunc()" 
         db -1              ; Feature not supported 
       %endif

       or, if the warning is not needed, using the function form:

         db %cond(%isdef(%newfunc),%newfunc(99),-1)

       It is strongly recommended to use this test instead of relying on
       NASM version numbers. To make it possible to test that this use of
       `%ifdef' is valid, the macro `__?NASM_HAS_IFDIRECTIVE?__' is defined
       on versions of NASM that support `%ifdirective', `%ifusable',
       `%ifusing' and using `%ifdef' to test for preprocessor functions.
       See section 6.8.

 5.6.3 `%ifdefalias': Testing Single-Line Macro Alias Existence

       The `%ifdefalias' directive operates in the same was as the `%ifdef'
       directive, except it tests for the definition of a single-line macro
       _alias_, as defined by `%defalias'.

 5.6.4 `%ifmacro': Testing Multi-Line Macro Existence

       The `%ifmacro' directive operates in the same way as the `%ifdef'
       directive, except that it checks for the existence of a multi-line
       macro.

       For example, you may be working with a large project and not have
       control over the macros in a library. You may want to create a macro
       with one name if it doesn't already exist, and another name if one
       with that name does exist.

       The `%ifmacro' is considered true if defining a macro with the given
       name and number of arguments would cause a definitions conflict. For
       example:

       %ifmacro MyMacro 1-3 
       
            %error "MyMacro 1-3" causes a conflict with an existing macro. 
       
       %else 
       
            %macro MyMacro 1-3 
       
                    ; insert code to define the macro 
       
            %endmacro 
       
       %endif

       This will create the macro "MyMacro 1-3" if no macro already exists
       which would conflict with it, and emits a warning if there would be
       a definition conflict.

 5.6.5 `%ifctx': Testing the Context Stack

       The conditional-assembly construct `%ifctx' will cause the
       subsequent code to be assembled if and only if the top context on
       the preprocessor's context stack has the same name as one of the
       arguments.

       For more details of the context stack, see section 5.9. For a sample
       use of `%ifctx', see section 5.9.6.

 5.6.6 `%ifidn' and `%ifidni': Testing Exact Text Identity

       The construct `%ifidn text1,text2' will cause the subsequent code to
       be assembled if and only if `text1' and `text2', after expanding
       single-line macros, are identical pieces of text. Differences in
       white space are not counted.

       `%ifidni' is similar to `%ifidn', but is case-insensitive.

       For example, the following macro pushes a register or number on the
       stack, and allows you to treat `IP' as a real register:

       %macro  pushparam 1 
       
         %ifidni %1,ip 
               call    %%label 
         %%label: 
         %else 
               push    %1 
         %endif 
       
       %endmacro

 5.6.7 `%ifid', `%ifnum', `%ifstr': Testing Token Types

       Some macros will want to perform different tasks depending on
       whether they are passed a number, a string, or an identifier. For
       example, a string output macro might want to be able to cope with
       being passed either a string constant or a pointer to an existing
       string.

       The conditional assembly construct `%ifid', taking one parameter
       (which may be blank), assembles the subsequent code if and only if
       _the first token_ in the parameter exists and is an identifier. `$'
       and `$$' are _not_ considered identifiers by `%ifid'.

       `%ifnum' works similarly, but tests for the token being an integer
       numeric constant (not an expression!) possibly preceded by `+' or
       `-'; `%ifstr' tests for it being a quoted string.

       For example, the `writefile' macro defined in section 5.5.3 can be
       extended to take advantage of `%ifstr' in the following fashion:

       %macro writefile 2-3+ 
       
         %ifstr %2 
               jmp     %%endstr 
           %if %0 = 3 
             %%str:    db      %2,%3 
           %else 
             %%str:    db      %2 
           %endif 
             %%endstr: mov     dx,%%str 
                       mov     cx,%%endstr-%%str 
         %else 
                       mov     dx,%2 
                       mov     cx,%3 
         %endif 
                       mov     bx,%1 
                       mov     ah,0x40 
                       int     0x21 
       
       %endmacro

       Then the `writefile' macro can cope with being called in either of
       the following two ways:

               writefile [file], strpointer, length 
               writefile [file], "hello", 13, 10

       In the first, `strpointer' is used as the address of an already-
       declared string, and `length' is used as its length; in the second,
       a string is given to the macro, which therefore declares it itself
       and works out the address and length for itself.

       Note the use of `%if' inside the `%ifstr': this is to detect whether
       the macro was passed two arguments (so the string would be a single
       string constant, and `db %2' would be adequate) or more (in which
       case, all but the first two would be lumped together into `%3', and
       `db %2,%3' would be required).

 5.6.8 `%iftoken': Test for a Single Token

       Some macros will want to do different things depending on if it is
       passed a single token (e.g. paste it to something else using `%+')
       versus a multi-token sequence.

       The conditional assembly construct `%iftoken' assembles the
       subsequent code if and only if the expanded parameters consist of
       exactly one token, possibly surrounded by whitespace.

       For example:

       %iftoken 1

       will assemble the subsequent code, but

       %iftoken -1

       will not, since `-1' contains two tokens: the unary minus operator
       `-', and the number `1'.

 5.6.9 `%ifempty': Test for Empty Expansion

       The conditional assembly construct `%ifempty' assembles the
       subsequent code if and only if the expanded parameters do not
       contain any tokens at all, whitespace excepted.

5.6.10 `%ifdirective': Test If a Directive Is Supported

       The conditional assembly construct `%ifdirective' assembles the
       subsequent code if and only if followed by a token that corresponds
       to a preprocessor directive, assembler directive (see chapter 8) or
       a pseudo-instruction (see section 3.2) supported in the current
       version of NASM.

       The argument can be a quoted string to prevent macro expansion, in
       which case it is unquoted before the test, that is, these two lines
       do the same thing:

            %ifdirective %ifndef 
            %ifdirective "%ifndef"

       Preprocessor directives must be specified with a leading `%' sign
       (except for certain directives in TASM mode); assembler directives
       _may_ be specified with surrounding brackets `[]', but those are not
       required.

       Some assembly directives can be supported in some contexts and not
       others, for example, most output formats do not support the `ORG'
       directive, therefore the result of `%ifdirective' may depend on more
       than just the current version of NASM.

       `%ifdirective' was introduced in NASM 3.00. It is strongly
       recommended to use this test instead of relying on NASM version
       numbers. To make it possible to probe for the existence of this test
       itself, the macro `__?NASM_HAS_IFDIRECTIVE?__' is defined on
       versions of NASM that support `%ifdirective', `%ifusable',
       `%ifusing' and using `%ifdef' to test for preprocessor functions.

5.6.11 `%ifusable' and `%ifusing': Test For Standard Macro Packages

       The conditional assembly construct `%ifusable' assembles the
       subsequent code if and only if the following argument would be valid
       as the argument to `%use' (see section 5.8.4), in other words, that
       a standard macro package with that name is available in the current
       version of NASM.

       The conditional assembly construct `%ifusing' assembles the
       subsequent code if and only if the following argument would be valid
       as the argument to `%use'. It is more or less equivalent to the
       `__?USE_'_package_`?__' standard macros (see section 6.9) but is
       potentially more robust.

       `%ifusing' and `%ifusable' were introduced in NASM 3.00. It is
       strongly recommended to use this test instead of relying on NASM
       version numbers. To make it possible to probe for the existence of
       this test itself, the macro `__?NASM_HAS_IFDIRECTIVE?__' is defined
       on versions of NASM that support `%ifdirective', `%ifusable',
       `%ifusing' and using `%ifdef' to test for preprocessor functions.
       See section 6.8.

5.6.12 `%iffile': Test If a File Exists

       The conditional assembly construct `%iffile' assembles the
       subsequent code if and only if a quoted string is specified which
       contains the name of a file that is available for NASM to read.

       The include path is _not_ searched; to search for the file using the
       include path, use the `%pathsearch()' function in conjunction with
       this test, for example:

       %define MYFILE "file.asm" 
       %iffile %pathsearch(MYFILE) 
            ; ... 
       %endif

5.6.13 `%ifenv': Test If Environment Variable Exists

       The conditional assembly construct `%ifenv' assembles the subsequent
       code if and only if the environment variable referenced by the
       `%!'_variable_ directive exists.

       Just as for `%!'_variable_ the argument should be written as a
       string if it contains characters that would not be legal in an
       identifier. See section 5.13.2.

5.6.14 Backwards Compatibility Caveat

       Note that NASM before version 3.00 would not handle an unknown
       `%if'-type directive for the purpose of `%if'...`%endif' balancing.
       Therefore, something like this would not work:

       %ifdef __?NASM_HAS_IFDIRECTIVE?__        ; NASM 3.00 or later 
         %ifdirective %iffile                   ; Test for directive 
           %iffile MYFILE 
              incbin MYFILE 
           %endif 
         %endif 
       %endif

       This can be worked around by using the `%is()' series functions and
       plain `%if' instead:

       %ifdef __?NASM_HAS_IFDIRECTIVE?__        ; NASM 3.00 or later 
         %if %isdef(%isfile)                    ; Test for function 
           %if %isfile(MYFILE) 
              incbin MYFILE 
           %endif 
         %endif 
       %endif

       NASM 3.00 and later treats an unknown preprocessor directive
       beginning with `%if' or `%elif' as if it were a known conditional
       directive for the purpose of `%if'...`%endif' balancing.

   5.7 Preprocessor Loops: `%rep'

       NASM's `TIMES' prefix, though useful, cannot be used to invoke a
       multi-line macro multiple times, because it is processed by NASM
       after macros have already been expanded. Therefore NASM provides
       another form of loop, this time at the preprocessor level: `%rep'.

       The directives `%rep' and `%endrep' (`%rep' takes a numeric
       argument, which can be an expression; `%endrep' takes no arguments)
       can be used to enclose a chunk of code, which is then replicated as
       many times as specified by the preprocessor:

       %assign i 0 
       %rep    64 
               inc     word [table+2*i] 
       %assign i i+1 
       %endrep

       This will generate a sequence of 64 `INC' instructions, incrementing
       every word of memory from `[table]' to `[table+126]'.

       For more complex termination conditions, or to break out of a repeat
       loop part way along, you can use the `%exitrep' directive to
       terminate the loop, like this:

       fibonacci: 
       %assign i 0 
       %assign j 1 
       %rep 100 
       %if j > 65535 
           %exitrep 
       %endif 
               dw j 
       %assign k j+i 
       %assign i j 
       %assign j k 
       %endrep 
       
       fib_number equ ($-fibonacci)/2

       This produces a list of all the Fibonacci numbers that will fit in
       16 bits. Note that a maximum repeat count must still be given to
       `%rep'. This is to prevent the possibility of NASM getting into an
       infinite loop in the preprocessor, which (on multitasking or multi-
       user systems) would typically cause all the system memory to be
       gradually used up and other applications to start crashing.

       Note the maximum repeat count is limited to the value specified by
       the `--limit-rep' option or `%pragma limit rep', see section 2.1.32.

   5.8 Source Files and Dependencies

       These commands allow you to split your sources into multiple files.

 5.8.1 `%include': Including Other Files

       Using, once again, a very similar syntax to the C preprocessor,
       NASM's preprocessor lets you include other source files into your
       code. This is done by the use of the `%include' directive:

       %include "macros.mac"

       will include the contents of the file `macros.mac' into the source
       file containing the `%include' directive.

       Include files are searched for in the current directory (the
       directory you're in when you run NASM, as opposed to the location of
       the NASM executable or the location of the source file), plus any
       directories specified on the NASM command line using the `-i'
       option.

       The standard C idiom for preventing a file being included more than
       once is just as applicable in NASM: if the file `macros.mac' has the
       form

       %ifndef MACROS_MAC 
           %define MACROS_MAC 
           ; now define some macros 
       %endif

       then including the file more than once will not cause errors,
       because the second time the file is included nothing will happen
       because the macro `MACROS_MAC' will already be defined.

       You can force a file to be included even if there is no `%include'
       directive that explicitly includes it, by using the `-p' option on
       the NASM command line (see section 2.1.19).

 5.8.2 `%pathsearch': Search the Include Path

       The `%pathsearch' directive takes a single-line macro name and a
       filename, and declare or redefines the specified single-line macro
       to be the include-path-resolved version of the filename, if the file
       exists (otherwise, it is passed unchanged.)

       For example,

       %pathsearch MyFoo "foo.bin"

       ... with `-Ibins/' in the include path may end up defining the macro
       `MyFoo' to be `"bins/foo.bin"'.

       See also the `%pathsearch()' function (section 5.4.16).

 5.8.3 `%depend': Add Dependent Files

       The `%depend' directive takes a filename and adds it to the list of
       files to be emitted as dependency generation when the `-M' options
       and its relatives (see section 2.1.5) are used. It produces no
       output.

       This is generally used in conjunction with `%pathsearch'. For
       example, a simplified version of the standard macro wrapper for the
       `INCBIN' directive looks like:

       %imacro incbin 1-2+ 0 
       %pathsearch dep %1 
       %depend dep 
               incbin dep,%2 
       %endmacro

       This first resolves the location of the file into the macro `dep',
       then adds it to the dependency lists, and finally issues the
       assembler-level `INCBIN' directive.

       See also the `%depend()' function (section 5.4.6).

 5.8.4 `%use': Include Standard Macro Package

       The `%use' directive is similar to `%include', but rather than
       including the contents of a file, it includes a named standard macro
       package. The standard macro packages are part of NASM, and are
       described in chapter 7.

       Unlike the `%include' directive, package names for the `%use'
       directive do not require quotes, but quotes are permitted. In NASM
       2.04 and 2.05 the unquoted form would be macro-expanded; this is no
       longer true. Thus, the following lines are equivalent:

       %use altreg 
       %use 'altreg'

       Standard macro packages are protected from multiple inclusion. When
       a standard macro package is used, a testable single-line macro of
       the form `__?USE_'_package_`?__' is also defined, see section 6.9.

       The `%ifusable' and `%ifusing' directives can be used for the
       existence and inclusion of a specific standard macro package, see
       `ifusing'.

   5.9 The Context Stack

       Having labels that are local to a macro definition is sometimes not
       quite powerful enough: sometimes you want to be able to share labels
       between several macro calls. An example might be a `REPEAT' ...
       `UNTIL' loop, in which the expansion of the `UNTIL' macro would need
       to be able to refer to a label which the `REPEAT' macro had defined.
       However, for such a macro you would also want to be able to nest
       these loops.

       NASM provides this level of power by means of a _context stack_. The
       preprocessor maintains a stack of _contexts_, each of which is
       characterized by a name. You add a new context to the stack using
       the `%push' directive, and remove one using `%pop'. You can define
       labels that are local to a particular context on the stack.

 5.9.1 `%push' and `%pop': Creating and Removing Contexts

       The `%push' directive is used to create a new context and place it
       on the top of the context stack. `%push' takes an optional argument,
       which is the name of the context. For example:

       %push    foobar

       This pushes a new context called `foobar' on the stack. You can have
       several contexts on the stack with the same name: they can still be
       distinguished. If no name is given, the context is unnamed (this is
       normally used when both the `%push' and the `%pop' are inside a
       single macro definition).

       The directive `%pop', taking one optional argument, removes the top
       context from the context stack and destroys it, along with any
       labels associated with it. If an argument is given, it must match
       the name of the current context, otherwise it will issue an error.

 5.9.2 Context-Local Labels

       Just as the usage `%%foo' defines a label which is local to the
       particular macro call in which it is used, the usage `%$foo' is used
       to define a label which is local to the context on the top of the
       context stack. So the `REPEAT' and `UNTIL' example given above could
       be implemented by means of:

       %macro repeat 0 
       
           %push   repeat 
           %$begin: 
       
       %endmacro 
       
       %macro until 1 
       
               j%-1    %$begin 
           %pop 
       
       %endmacro

       and invoked by means of, for example,

               mov     di,string 
               repeat 
               add     di,3 
               scasb 
               until   e

       which would scan every fourth byte of a string in search of the byte
       in `AL'.

       If you need to define, or access, labels local to the context
       _below_ the top one on the stack, you can use `%$$foo', or `%$$$foo'
       for the context below that, and so on.

 5.9.3 Context-Local Single-Line Macros

       NASM also allows you to define single-line macros which are local to
       a particular context, in just the same way:

       %define %$localmac 3

       will define the single-line macro `%$localmac' to be local to the
       top context on the stack. Of course, after a subsequent `%push', it
       can then still be accessed by the name `%$$localmac'.

 5.9.4 Context Fall-Through Lookup _(deprecated)_

       Context fall-through lookup (automatic searching of outer contexts)
       is a feature that was added in NASM version 0.98.03. Unfortunately,
       this feature is unintuitive and can result in buggy code that would
       have otherwise been prevented by NASM's error reporting. As a
       result, this feature has been _deprecated_. NASM version 2.09 will
       issue a warning when usage of this _deprecated_ feature is detected.
       Starting with NASM version 2.10, usage of this _deprecated_ feature
       will simply result in an _expression syntax error_.

       An example usage of this _deprecated_ feature follows:

       %macro ctxthru 0 
       %push ctx1 
           %assign %$external 1 
               %push ctx2 
                   %assign %$internal 1 
                   mov eax, %$external 
                   mov eax, %$internal 
               %pop 
       %pop 
       %endmacro

       As demonstrated, `%$external' is being defined in the `ctx1' context
       and referenced within the `ctx2' context. With context fall-through
       lookup, referencing an undefined context-local macro like this
       implicitly searches through all outer contexts until a match is made
       or isn't found in any context. As a result, `%$external' referenced
       within the `ctx2' context would implicitly use `%$external' as
       defined in `ctx1'. Most people would expect NASM to issue an error
       in this situation because `%$external' was never defined within
       `ctx2' and also isn't qualified with the proper context depth,
       `%$$external'.

       Here is a revision of the above example with proper context depth:

       %macro ctxthru 0 
       %push ctx1 
           %assign %$external 1 
               %push ctx2 
                   %assign %$internal 1 
                   mov eax, %$$external 
                   mov eax, %$internal 
               %pop 
       %pop 
       %endmacro

       As demonstrated, `%$external' is still being defined in the `ctx1'
       context and referenced within the `ctx2' context. However, the
       reference to `%$external' within `ctx2' has been fully qualified
       with the proper context depth, `%$$external', and thus is no longer
       ambiguous, unintuitive or erroneous.

 5.9.5 `%repl': Renaming a Context

       If you need to change the name of the top context on the stack (in
       order, for example, to have it respond differently to `%ifctx'), you
       can execute a `%pop' followed by a `%push'; but this will have the
       side effect of destroying all context-local labels and macros
       associated with the context that was just popped.

       NASM provides the directive `%repl', which _replaces_ a context with
       a different name, without touching the associated macros and labels.
       So you could replace the destructive code

       %pop 
       %push   newname

       with the non-destructive version `%repl newname'.

 5.9.6 Example Use of the Context Stack: Block IFs

       This example makes use of almost all the context-stack features,
       including the conditional-assembly construct `%ifctx', to implement
       a block IF statement as a set of macros.

       %macro if 1 
       
           %push if 
           j%-1  %$ifnot 
       
       %endmacro 
       
       %macro else 0 
       
         %ifctx if 
               %repl   else 
               jmp     %$ifend 
               %$ifnot: 
         %else 
               %error  "expected `if' before `else'" 
         %endif 
       
       %endmacro 
       
       %macro endif 0 
       
         %ifctx if 
               %$ifnot: 
               %pop 
         %elifctx      else 
               %$ifend: 
               %pop 
         %else 
               %error  "expected `if' or `else' before `endif'" 
         %endif 
       
       %endmacro

       This code is more robust than the `REPEAT' and `UNTIL' macros given
       in section 5.9.2, because it uses conditional assembly to check that
       the macros are issued in the right order (for example, not calling
       `endif' before `if') and issues an `%error' if they're not.

       In addition, the `endif' macro has to be able to cope with the two
       distinct cases of either directly following an `if', or following an
       `else'. It achieves this, again, by using conditional assembly to do
       different things depending on whether the context on top of the
       stack is `if' or `else'.

       The `else' macro has to preserve the context on the stack, in order
       to have the `%$ifnot' referred to by the `if' macro be the same as
       the one defined by the `endif' macro, but has to change the
       context's name so that `endif' will know there was an intervening
       `else'. It does this by the use of `%repl'.

       A sample usage of these macros might look like:

               cmp     ax,bx 
       
               if ae 
                      cmp     bx,cx 
       
                      if ae 
                              mov     ax,cx 
                      else 
                              mov     ax,bx 
                      endif 
       
               else 
                      cmp     ax,cx 
       
                      if ae 
                              mov     ax,cx 
                      endif 
       
               endif

       The block-`IF' macros handle nesting quite happily, by means of
       pushing another context, describing the inner `if', on top of the
       one describing the outer `if'; thus `else' and `endif' always refer
       to the last unmatched `if' or `else'.

  5.10 Stack Relative Preprocessor Directives

       The following preprocessor directives provide a way to use labels to
       refer to local variables allocated on the stack.

       (*) `%arg' (see section 5.10.1)

       (*) `%stacksize' (see section 5.10.2)

       (*) `%local' (see section 5.10.3)

5.10.1 `%arg' Directive

       The `%arg' directive is used to simplify the handling of parameters
       passed on the stack. Stack based parameter passing is used by many
       high level languages, including C, C++ and Pascal.

       While NASM has macros which attempt to duplicate this functionality
       (see section 10.4.5), the syntax is not particularly convenient to
       use and is not TASM compatible. Here is an example which shows the
       use of `%arg' without any external macros:

       some_function: 
       
           %push     mycontext        ; save the current context 
           %stacksize large           ; tell NASM to use bp 
           %arg      i:word, j_ptr:word 
       
               mov     ax,[i] 
               mov     bx,[j_ptr] 
               add     ax,[bx] 
               ret 
       
           %pop                       ; restore original context

       This is similar to the procedure defined in section 10.4.5 and adds
       the value in i to the value pointed to by j_ptr and returns the sum
       in the ax register. See section 5.9.1 for an explanation of `push'
       and `pop' and the use of context stacks.

5.10.2 `%stacksize' Directive

       The `%stacksize' directive is used in conjunction with the `%arg'
       (see section 5.10.1) and the `%local' (see section 5.10.3)
       directives. It tells NASM the default size to use for subsequent
       `%arg' and `%local' directives. The `%stacksize' directive takes one
       required argument which is one of `flat', `flat64', `large' or
       `small'.

       %stacksize flat

       This form causes NASM to use stack-based parameter addressing
       relative to `ebp' and it assumes that a near form of call was used
       to get to this label (i.e. that `eip' is on the stack).

       %stacksize flat64

       This form causes NASM to use stack-based parameter addressing
       relative to `rbp' and it assumes that a near form of call was used
       to get to this label (i.e. that `rip' is on the stack).

       %stacksize large

       This form uses `bp' to do stack-based parameter addressing and
       assumes that a far form of call was used to get to this address
       (i.e. that `ip' and `cs' are on the stack).

       %stacksize small

       This form also uses `bp' to address stack parameters, but it is
       different from `large' because it also assumes that the old value of
       bp is pushed onto the stack (i.e. it expects an `ENTER'
       instruction). In other words, it expects that `bp', `ip' and `cs'
       are on the top of the stack, underneath any local space which may
       have been allocated by `ENTER'. This form is probably most useful
       when used in combination with the `%local' directive (see section
       5.10.3).

5.10.3 `%local' Directive

       The `%local' directive is used to simplify the use of local
       temporary stack variables allocated in a stack frame. Automatic
       local variables in C are an example of this kind of variable. The
       `%local' directive is most useful when used with the `%stacksize'
       (see section 5.10.2 and is also compatible with the `%arg' directive
       (see section 5.10.1). It allows simplified reference to variables on
       the stack which have been allocated typically by using the `ENTER'
       instruction. An example of its use is the following:

       silly_swap: 
       
           %push mycontext             ; save the current context 
           %stacksize small            ; tell NASM to use bp 
           %assign %$localsize 0       ; see text for explanation 
           %local old_ax:word, old_dx:word 
       
               enter   %$localsize,0   ; see text for explanation 
               mov     [old_ax],ax     ; swap ax & bx 
               mov     [old_dx],dx     ; and swap dx & cx 
               mov     ax,bx 
               mov     dx,cx 
               mov     bx,[old_ax] 
               mov     cx,[old_dx] 
               leave                   ; restore old bp 
               ret                     ; 
       
           %pop                        ; restore original context

       The `%$localsize' variable is used internally by the `%local'
       directive and _must_ be defined within the current context before
       the `%local' directive may be used. Failure to do so will result in
       one expression syntax error for each `%local' variable declared. It
       then may be used in the construction of an appropriately sized
       `ENTER' instruction as shown in the example.

  5.11 Reporting User-generated Diagnostics: `%error', `%warning', `%fatal', `%note'

       The preprocessor directive `%error' will cause NASM to report an
       error if it occurs in assembled code. So if other users are going to
       try to assemble your source files, you can ensure that they define
       the right macros by means of code like this:

       %ifdef F1 
           ; do some setup 
       %elifdef F2 
           ; do some different setup 
       %else 
           %error "Neither F1 nor F2 was defined." 
       %endif

       Then any user who fails to understand the way your code is supposed
       to be assembled will be quickly warned of their mistake, rather than
       having to wait until the program crashes on being run and then not
       knowing what went wrong.

       Similarly, `%warning' issues a warning, but allows assembly to
       continue:

       %ifdef F1 
           ; do some setup 
       %elifdef F2 
           ; do some different setup 
       %else 
           %warning "Neither F1 nor F2 was defined, assuming F1." 
           %define F1 
       %endif

       User-defined error messages can be suppressed with the `-w-user'
       option, and promoted to errors with `-w+error=user'.

       `%error' and `%warning' are issued only on the final assembly pass.
       This makes them safe to use in conjunction with tests that depend on
       symbol values.

       `%fatal' terminates assembly immediately, regardless of pass. This
       is useful when there is no point in continuing the assembly further,
       and doing so is likely just going to cause a spew of confusing error
       messages.

       `%note' adds an output line to the list file; it does not output
       anything on the console or error file.

       It is optional for the message string after `%error', `%warning',
       `%fatal', or `%note' to be quoted. If it is _not_, then single-line
       macros are expanded in it, which can be used to display more
       information to the user. For example:

       %if foo > 64 
           %assign foo_over foo-64 
           %error foo is foo_over bytes too large 
       %endif

  5.12 `%pragma': Setting Options

       The `%pragma' directive controls a number of options in NASM.
       Pragmas are intended to remain backwards compatible, and therefore
       an unknown `%pragma' directive is not an error.

       The various pragmas are documented with the options they affect.

       The general structure of a NASM pragma is:

       `%pragma' _namespace_ _directive_ [_arguments..._]

       Currently defined namespaces are:

       (*) `ignore': this `%pragma' is unconditionally ignored.

       (*) `preproc': preprocessor, see section 5.12.1.

       (*) `limit': resource limits, see section 2.1.32.

       (*) `asm': the parser and assembler proper. Currently no such
           pragmas are defined.

       (*) `list': listing options, see section 2.1.4.

       (*) `file': general file handling options. Currently no such pragmas
           are defined.

       (*) `input': input file handling options. Currently no such pragmas
           are defined.

       (*) `output': output format options.

       (*) `debug': debug format options.

       In addition, the name of any output or debug format, and sometimes
       groups thereof, also constitute `%pragma' namespaces. The namespaces
       `output' and `debug' simply refer to _any_ output or debug format,
       respectively.

       For example, to prepend an underscore to global symbols regardless
       of the output format (see section 8.10):

       %pragma output gprefix _

       ... whereas to prepend an underscore to global symbols only when the
       output is either `win32' or `win64':

       %pragma win gprefix _

5.12.1 Preprocessor Pragmas

       The only preprocessor `%pragma' defined as the current version of
       NASM is:

       (*) `%pragma preproc sane_empty_expansion': disables legacy
           compatibility handling of braceless empty arguments to multi-
           line macros. See section 5.5 and section 2.1.26.

  5.13 Other Preprocessor Directives

5.13.1 `%line' Directive

       The `%line' directive is used to notify NASM that the input line
       corresponds to a specific line number in another file. Typically
       this other file would be an original source file, with the current
       NASM input being the output of a pre-processor. The `%line'
       directive allows NASM to output messages which indicate the line
       number of the original source file, instead of the file that is
       being read by NASM.

       This preprocessor directive is not generally used directly by
       programmers, but may be of interest to preprocessor authors. The
       usage of the `%line' preprocessor directive is as follows:

       %line nnn[+mmm] [filename]

       In this directive, `nnn' identifies the line of the original source
       file which this line corresponds to. `mmm' is an optional parameter
       which specifies a line increment value; each line of the input file
       read in is considered to correspond to `mmm' lines of the original
       source file. Finally, `filename' is an optional parameter which
       specifies the file name of the original source file. It may be a
       quoted string, in which case any additional argument after the
       quoted string will be ignored.

       After reading a `%line' preprocessor directive, NASM will report all
       file name and line numbers relative to the values specified therein.

       If the command line option `--no-line' is given, all `%line'
       directives are ignored. This may be useful for debugging
       preprocessed code. See section 2.1.34.

       Starting in NASM 2.15, `%line' directives are processed before any
       other processing takes place.

       For compatibility with the output from some other preprocessors,
       including many C preprocessors, a `#' character followed by
       whitespace _at the very beginning of a line_ is also treated as a
       `%line' directive, except that double quotes surrounding the
       filename are treated like NASM backquotes, with `\'-escaped
       sequences decoded.

5.13.2 `%!'_variable_: Read an Environment Variable.

       The `%!'_variable_ directive makes it possible to read the value of
       an environment variable at assembly time. This could, for example,
       be used to store the contents of an environment variable into a
       string, which could be used at some other point in your code.

       For example, suppose that you have an environment variable `FOO',
       and you want the contents of `FOO' to be embedded in your program as
       a quoted string. You could do that as follows:

       %defstr FOO          %!FOO

       See section 5.2.9 for notes on the `%defstr' directive.

       If the name of the environment variable contains non-identifier
       characters, you can use string quotes to surround the name of the
       variable, for example:

       %defstr C_colon      %!'C:'

5.13.3 `%clear': Clear All Macro Definitions

       The directive `%clear' clears all definitions of a certain type,
       _including the ones defined by NASM itself._ This can be useful when
       preprocessing non-NASM code, or to drop backwards compatibility
       aliases.

       The syntax is:

          %clear [global|context] type...

       ... where `context' indicates that this applies to context-local
       macros only; the default is `global'.

       `type' can be one or more of:

       (*) `define' single-line macros

       (*) `defalias' single-line macro aliases (useful to remove backwards
           compatibility aliases)

       (*) `alldefine' same as `define defalias'

       (*) `macro' multi-line macros

       (*) `all' same as `alldefine macro' (default)

       In NASM 2.14 and earlier, only the single syntax `%clear' was
       supported, which is equivalent to `%clear global all'.

Chapter 6: Standard Macros
--------------------------

       NASM defines a set of standard macros, which are already defined
       when it starts to process any source file. If you really need a
       program to be assembled with no pre-defined macros, you can use the
       `%clear' directive to empty the preprocessor of everything but
       context-local preprocessor variables and single-line macros, see
       section 5.13.3.

       Most user-level directives (see chapter 8) are implemented as macros
       which invoke primitive directives; these are described in chapter 8.
       The rest of the standard macro set is described here.

       For compatibility with NASM versions before NASM 2.15, most standard
       macros of the form `__?foo?__' have aliases of form `__foo__' (see
       section 5.2.11). These can be removed with the directive
       `%clear defalias'.

   6.1 NASM Version Macros

       The single-line macros `__?NASM_MAJOR?__', `__?NASM_MINOR?__',
       `__?NASM_SUBMINOR?__' and `__?NASM_PATCHLEVEL?__' expand to the
       major, minor, subminor and patch level parts of the version number
       of NASM being used. So, under NASM 0.98.32p1 for example,
       `__?NASM_MAJOR?__' would be defined to be 0, `__?NASM_MINOR?__'
       would be defined as 98, `__?NASM_SUBMINOR?__' would be defined to
       32, and `__?NASM_PATCHLEVEL?__' would be defined as 1.

       Additionally, the macro `__?NASM_SNAPSHOT?__' is defined for
       automatically generated snapshot releases _only_.

 6.1.1 `__?NASM_VERSION_ID?__': NASM Version ID

       The single-line macro `__?NASM_VERSION_ID?__' expands to a dword
       integer representing the full version number of the version of nasm
       being used. The value is the equivalent to `__?NASM_MAJOR?__',
       `__?NASM_MINOR?__', `__?NASM_SUBMINOR?__' and
       `__?NASM_PATCHLEVEL?__' concatenated to produce a single doubleword.
       Hence, for 0.98.32p1, the returned number would be equivalent to:

               dd      0x00622001

       or

               db      1,32,98,0

       Note that the above lines generate exactly the same code, the second
       line is used just to give an indication of the order that the
       separate values will be present in memory.

 6.1.2 `__?NASM_VER?__': NASM Version String

       The single-line macro `__?NASM_VER?__' expands to a string which
       defines the version number of nasm being used. So, under NASM
       0.98.32 for example,

               db      __?NASM_VER?__

       would expand to

               db      "0.98.32"

   6.2 `__?FILE?__' and `__?LINE?__': File Name and Line Number

       Like the C preprocessor, NASM allows the user to find out the file
       name and line number containing the current instruction. The macro
       `__?FILE?__' expands to a string constant giving the name of the
       current input file (which may change through the course of assembly
       if `%include' directives are used), and `__?LINE?__' expands to a
       numeric constant giving the current line number in the input file.

       These macros could be used, for example, to communicate debugging
       information to a macro, since invoking `__?LINE?__' inside a macro
       definition (either single-line or multi-line) will return the line
       number of the macro _call_, rather than _definition_. So to
       determine where in a piece of code a crash is occurring, for
       example, one could write a routine `stillhere', which is passed a
       line number in `EAX' and outputs something like
       `line 155: still here'. You could then write a macro:

       %macro  notdeadyet 0 
       
               push    eax 
               mov     eax,__?LINE?__ 
               call    stillhere 
               pop     eax 
       
       %endmacro

       and then pepper your code with calls to `notdeadyet' until you find
       the crash point.

   6.3 `__?BITS?__': Current Code Generation Mode

       The `__?BITS?__' standard macro is updated every time that the BITS
       mode is set using the `BITS XX' or `[BITS XX]' directive, where XX
       is a valid mode number of 16, 32 or 64. `__?BITS?__' receives the
       specified mode number and makes it globally available. This can be
       very useful for those who utilize mode-dependent macros.

   6.4 `__?DEFAULT?__': `DEFAULT' directive settings

       The `__?DEFAULT?__' standard macro contains a comma-separated list
       of all possible settings of the `DEFAULT' directive (see section
       8.2), including ones which are set as NASM defaults. For example,
       after:

            default rel, fs:rel

       ... the `__?DEFAULT?__' macro might expand to:

            rel,fs:rel,gs:abs,nobnd

   6.5 `__?OUTPUT_FORMAT?__': Current Output Format

       The `__?OUTPUT_FORMAT?__' standard macro holds the current output
       format name, as given by the `-f' option or NASM's default. Type
       `nasm -h' for a list.

       %ifidn __?OUTPUT_FORMAT?__, win32 
        %define NEWLINE 13, 10 
       %elifidn __?OUTPUT_FORMAT?__, elf32 
        %define NEWLINE 10 
       %endif

   6.6 `__?DEBUG_FORMAT?__': Current Debug Format

       If debugging information generation is enabled, The
       `__?DEBUG_FORMAT?__' standard macro holds the current debug format
       name as specified by the `-F' or `-g' option or the output format
       default. Type `nasm -f' _output_ `y' for a list.

       `__?DEBUG_FORMAT?__' is not defined if debugging is not enabled, or
       if the debug format specified is `null'.

   6.7 Assembly Date and Time Macros

       NASM provides a variety of macros that represent the timestamp of
       the assembly session.

       (*) The `__?DATE?__' and `__?TIME?__' macros give the assembly date
           and time as strings, in ISO 8601 format (`"YYYY-MM-DD"' and
           `"HH:MM:SS"', respectively.)

       (*) The `__?DATE_NUM?__' and `__?TIME_NUM?__' macros give the
           assembly date and time in numeric form; in the format `YYYYMMDD'
           and `HHMMSS' respectively.

       (*) The `__?UTC_DATE?__' and `__?UTC_TIME?__' macros give the
           assembly date and time in universal time (UTC) as strings, in
           ISO 8601 format (`"YYYY-MM-DD"' and `"HH:MM:SS"', respectively.)
           If the host platform doesn't provide UTC time, these macros are
           undefined.

       (*) The `__?UTC_DATE_NUM?__' and `__?UTC_TIME_NUM?__' macros give
           the assembly date and time universal time (UTC) in numeric form;
           in the format `YYYYMMDD' and `HHMMSS' respectively. If the host
           platform doesn't provide UTC time, these macros are undefined.

       (*) The `__?POSIX_TIME?__' macro is defined as a number containing
           the number of seconds since the POSIX epoch, 1 January 1970
           00:00:00 UTC; excluding any leap seconds. This is computed using
           UTC time if available on the host platform, otherwise it is
           computed using the local time as if it was UTC.

       All instances of time and date macros in the same assembly session
       produce consistent output. For example, in an assembly session
       started at 42 seconds after midnight on January 1, 2010 in Moscow
       (timezone UTC+3) these macros would have the following values,
       assuming, of course, a properly configured environment with a
       correct clock:

             __?DATE?__             "2010-01-01" 
             __?TIME?__             "00:00:42" 
             __?DATE_NUM?__         20100101 
             __?TIME_NUM?__         000042 
             __?UTC_DATE?__         "2009-12-31" 
             __?UTC_TIME?__         "21:00:42" 
             __?UTC_DATE_NUM?__     20091231 
             __?UTC_TIME_NUM?__     210042 
             __?POSIX_TIME?__       1262293242

   6.8 `__?NASM_HAS_IFDIRECTIVE?__': Directive Probing Support

       The standard macro `__?NASM_HAS_IFDIRECTIVE?__' is defined if this
       version of NASM supports the preprocessor tests `%ifdirective',
       `%ifusable' and `%ifusing', and supports using `%ifdef' to test for
       the presence of preprocessor functions. See section 5.6.2, section
       5.6.10, and section 5.6.11.

       It is strongly suggested to test for the presence of this macro and,
       if present, relying on the corresponding tests instead of relying on
       NASM version number tests.

       However, see section 5.6.14 for an important caveat.

   6.9 `__?USE_'_package_`?__': Package Include Test

       When a standard macro package (see chapter 7) is included with the
       `%use' directive (see section 5.8.4), a single-line macro of the
       form `__?USE_'_package_`?__' is automatically defined. This allows
       testing if a particular package is invoked or not.

       For example, if the `altreg' package is included (see section 7.1),
       then the macro `__?USE_ALTREG?__' is defined.

       See also the `%ifusable' and `%ifusing' directives, section 5.6.11.

  6.10 `__?PASS?__': Assembly Pass

       The macro `__?PASS?__' is defined to be `1' on preparatory passes,
       and `2' on the final pass. In preprocess-only mode, it is set to
       `3', and when running only to generate dependencies (due to the `-M'
       or `-MG' option, see section 2.1.5) it is set to `0'.

       _Avoid using this macro if at all possible. It is tremendously easy
       to generate very strange errors by misusing it, and the semantics
       may change in future versions of NASM._

  6.11 Structure Data Types

6.11.1 `STRUC' and `ENDSTRUC': Declaring Structure Data Types

       The core of NASM contains no intrinsic means of defining data
       structures; instead, the preprocessor is sufficiently powerful that
       data structures can be implemented as a set of macros. The macros
       `STRUC' and `ENDSTRUC' are used to define a structure data type.

       `STRUC' takes one or two parameters. The first parameter is the name
       of the data type. The second, optional parameter is the base offset
       of the structure. The name of the data type is defined as a symbol
       with the value of the base offset, and the name of the data type
       with the suffix `_size' appended to it is defined as an `EQU' giving
       the size of the structure. Once `STRUC' has been issued, you are
       defining the structure, and should define fields using the `RESB'
       family of pseudo-instructions, and then invoke `ENDSTRUC' to finish
       the definition.

       For example, to define a structure called `mytype' containing a
       longword, a word, a byte and a string of bytes, you might code

       struc   mytype 
       
         mt_long:      resd    1 
         mt_word:      resw    1 
         mt_byte:      resb    1 
         mt_str:       resb    32 
       
       endstruc

       The above code defines six symbols: `mt_long' as 0 (the offset from
       the beginning of a `mytype' structure to the longword field),
       `mt_word' as 4, `mt_byte' as 6, `mt_str' as 7, `mytype_size' as 39,
       and `mytype' itself as zero.

       The reason why the structure type name is defined at zero by default
       is a side effect of allowing structures to work with the local label
       mechanism: if your structure members tend to have the same names in
       more than one structure, you can define the above structure like
       this:

       struc mytype 
       
         .long:        resd    1 
         .word:        resw    1 
         .byte:        resb    1 
         .str:         resb    32 
       
       endstruc

       This defines the offsets to the structure fields as `mytype.long',
       `mytype.word', `mytype.byte' and `mytype.str'.

       NASM, since it has no _intrinsic_ structure support, does not
       support any form of period notation to refer to the elements of a
       structure once you have one (except the above local-label notation),
       so code such as `mov ax,[mystruc.mt_word]' is not valid. `mt_word'
       is a constant just like any other constant, so the correct syntax is
       `mov ax,[mystruc+mt_word]' or `mov ax,[mystruc+mytype.word]'.

       Sometimes you only have the address of the structure displaced by an
       offset. For example, consider this standard stack frame setup:

       push ebp 
       mov ebp, esp 
       sub esp, 40

       In this case, you could access an element by subtracting the offset:

       mov [ebp - 40 + mytype.word], ax

       However, if you do not want to repeat this offset, you can use -40
       as a base offset:

       struc mytype, -40

       And access an element this way:

       mov [ebp + mytype.word], ax

6.11.2 `ISTRUC', `AT' and `IEND': Declaring Instances of Structures

       Having defined a structure type, the next thing you typically want
       to do is to declare instances of that structure in your data
       segment. NASM provides an easy way to do this in the `ISTRUC'
       mechanism. To declare a structure of type `mytype' in a program, you
       code something like this:

       mystruc: 
           istruc mytype 
       
               at mt_long, dd      123456 
               at mt_word, dw      1024 
               at mt_byte, db      'x' 
               at mt_str,  db      'hello, world', 13, 10, 0 
       
           iend

       The function of the `AT' macro is to make use of the `TIMES' prefix
       to advance the assembly position to the correct point for the
       specified structure field, and then to declare the specified data.
       Therefore the structure fields must be declared in the same order as
       they were specified in the structure definition.

       If the data to go in a structure field requires more than one source
       line to specify, the remaining source lines can easily come after
       the `AT' line. For example:

               at mt_str,  db      123,134,145,156,167,178,189 
                           db      190,100,0

       Depending on personal taste, you can also omit the code part of the
       `AT' line completely, and start the structure field on the next
       line:

               at mt_str 
                       db      'hello, world' 
                       db      13,10,0

  6.12 Alignment Control

6.12.1 `ALIGN' and `ALIGNB': Code and Data Alignment

       The `ALIGN' and `ALIGNB' macros provides a convenient way to align
       code or data on a word, longword, paragraph or other boundary. (Some
       assemblers call this directive `EVEN'.) The syntax of the `ALIGN'
       and `ALIGNB' macros is

               align   4               ; align on 4-byte boundary 
               align   16              ; align on 16-byte boundary 
               align   8,db 0          ; pad with 0s rather than NOPs 
               align   4,resb 1        ; align to 4 in the BSS 
               alignb  4               ; equivalent to previous line

       Both macros require their first argument to be a power of two; they
       both compute the number of additional bytes required to bring the
       length of the current section up to a multiple of that power of two,
       and then apply the `TIMES' prefix to their second argument to
       perform the alignment.

       If the second argument is not specified, the default for `ALIGN' is
       `NOP', and the default for `ALIGNB' is `RESB 1'. So if the second
       argument is specified, the two macros are equivalent. Normally, you
       can just use `ALIGN' in code and data sections and `ALIGNB' in BSS
       sections, and never need the second argument except for special
       purposes.

       `ALIGN' and `ALIGNB', being simple macros, perform no error
       checking: they cannot warn you if their first argument fails to be a
       power of two, or if their second argument generates more than one
       byte of code. In each of these cases they will silently do the wrong
       thing.

       `ALIGNB' (or `ALIGN' with a second argument of `RESB 1') can be used
       within structure definitions:

       struc mytype2 
       
         mt_byte: 
               resb 1 
               alignb 2 
         mt_word: 
               resw 1 
               alignb 4 
         mt_long: 
               resd 1 
         mt_str: 
               resb 32 
       
       endstruc

       This will ensure that the structure members are sensibly aligned
       relative to the base of the structure.

       A final caveat: `ALIGN' and `ALIGNB' work relative to the beginning
       of the _section_, not the beginning of the address space in the
       final executable. Aligning to a 16-byte boundary when the section
       you're in is only guaranteed to be aligned to a 4-byte boundary, for
       example, is a waste of effort. Again, NASM does not check that the
       section's alignment characteristics are sensible for the use of
       `ALIGN' or `ALIGNB'.

       Both `ALIGN' and `ALIGNB' do call `SECTALIGN' macro implicitly. See
       section 6.12.2 for details.

       See also the `smartalign' standard macro package, section 7.2.

6.12.2 `SECTALIGN': Section Alignment

       The `SECTALIGN' macros provides a way to modify alignment attribute
       of output file section. Unlike the `align=' attribute (which is
       allowed at section definition only) the `SECTALIGN' macro may be
       used at any time.

       For example the directive

       SECTALIGN 16

       sets the section alignment requirements to 16 bytes. Once increased
       it can not be decreased, the magnitude may grow only.

       Note that `ALIGN' (see section 6.12.1) calls the `SECTALIGN' macro
       implicitly so the active section alignment requirements may be
       updated. This is by default behaviour, if for some reason you want
       the `ALIGN' do not call `SECTALIGN' at all use the directive

       SECTALIGN OFF

       It is still possible to turn in on again by

       SECTALIGN ON

       Note that `SECTALIGN <ON|OFF>' affects only the `ALIGN'/`ALIGNB'
       directives, not an explicit `SECTALIGN' directive.

Chapter 7: Standard Macro Packages
----------------------------------

       The `%use' directive (see section 5.8.4) includes one of the
       standard macro packages included with the NASM distribution and
       compiled into the NASM binary. It operates like the `%include'
       directive (see section 5.8.1), but the included contents is provided
       by NASM itself.

       The names of standard macro packages are case insensitive and can be
       quoted or not.

       As of version 2.15, NASM has `%ifusable' and `%ifusing' directives
       to help the user understand whether an individual package available
       in this version of NASM (`%ifusable') or a particular package
       already loaded (`%ifusing').

   7.1 `altreg': Alternate Register Names

       The `altreg' standard macro package provides alternate register
       names. It provides numeric register names for all registers (not
       just `R8'-`R31'), the Intel-defined aliases `R8L'-`R31L' for the low
       bytes of registers (as opposed to the NASM/AMD standard names `R8B'-
       `R31B'), and the names `R0H'-`R3H' (by analogy with `R0L'-`R3L') for
       `AH', `CH', `DH', and `BH'.

       Example use:

       %use altreg 
       
       proc: 
             mov r0l,r3h                    ; mov al,bh 
             ret

       See also section 13.1 and section 4.6.1.

   7.2 `smartalign': Smart `ALIGN' Macro

       The `smartalign' standard macro package provides an `ALIGN' macro
       which is more powerful than the default (and backwards-compatible)
       one (see section 6.12.1). When the `smartalign' package is enabled,
       when `ALIGN' is used without a second argument, NASM will generate a
       sequence of instructions more efficient than a series of `NOP'.
       Furthermore, if the padding exceeds a specific threshold, then NASM
       will generate a jump over the entire padding sequence.

       The specific instructions generated can be controlled with the new
       `ALIGNMODE' macro. This macro takes two parameters: one mode, and an
       optional jump threshold override. If (for any reason) you need to
       turn off the jump completely just set jump threshold value to -1 (or
       set it to `nojmp'). The following modes are possible:

       (*) `generic': Works on all x86 CPUs and should have reasonable
           performance. The default jump threshold is 8. This is the
           default.

       (*) `nop': Pad out with `NOP' instructions. The only difference
           compared to the standard `ALIGN' macro is that NASM can still
           jump over a large padding area. The default jump threshold is
           16.

       (*) `k7': Optimize for the AMD K7 (Athlon/Althon XP). These
           instructions should still work on all x86 CPUs. The default jump
           threshold is 16.

       (*) `k8': Optimize for the AMD K8 (Opteron/Althon 64). These
           instructions should still work on all x86 CPUs. The default jump
           threshold is 16.

       (*) `p6': Optimize for Intel CPUs. This uses the long `NOP'
           instructions first introduced in Pentium Pro. This is
           incompatible with all CPUs of family 5 or lower, as well as some
           VIA CPUs and several virtualization solutions. The default jump
           threshold is 16.

       The macro `__?ALIGNMODE?__' is defined to contain the current
       alignment mode. A number of other macros beginning with `__?ALIGN_'
       are used internally by this macro package.

   7.3 `fp': Floating-point macros

       This packages contains the following floating-point convenience
       macros:

       %define Inf             __?Infinity?__ 
       %define NaN             __?QNaN?__ 
       %define QNaN            __?QNaN?__ 
       %define SNaN            __?SNaN?__ 
       
       %define float8(x)       __?float8?__(x) 
       %define float16(x)      __?float16?__(x) 
       %define bfloat16(x)     __?bfloat16?__(x) 
       %define float32(x)      __?float32?__(x) 
       %define float64(x)      __?float64?__(x) 
       %define float80m(x)     __?float80m?__(x) 
       %define float80e(x)     __?float80e?__(x) 
       %define float128l(x)    __?float128l?__(x) 
       %define float128h(x)    __?float128h?__(x)

       It also defines the a multi-line macro `bf16' that can be used in a
       similar way to the `D'_x_ directives for the other floating-point
       numbers:

            bf16 -3.1415, NaN, 2000.0, +Inf

   7.4 `ifunc': Integer functions

       This package contains a set of macros which implement integer
       functions. These are actually implemented as special operators, but
       are most conveniently accessed via this macro package.

       The macros provided are:

 7.4.1 Integer logarithms

       These functions calculate the integer logarithm base 2 of their
       argument, considered as an unsigned integer. The only differences
       between the functions is their respective behavior if the argument
       provided is not a power of two.

       The function `ilog2e()' (alias `ilog2()') generates an error if the
       argument is not a power of two.

       The function `ilog2f()' rounds the argument down to the nearest
       power of two; if the argument is zero it returns zero.

       The function `ilog2c()' rounds the argument up to the nearest power
       of two.

       The functions `ilog2fw()' (alias `ilog2w()') and `ilog2cw()'
       generate a warning if the argument is not a power of two, but
       otherwise behaves like `ilog2f()' and `ilog2c()', respectively.

   7.5 `masm': MASM compatibility

       Since version 2.15, NASM has a MASM compatibility package with
       minimal functionality, as intended to be used primarily with
       machine-generated code. It does not include any "programmer-
       friendly" shortcuts, nor does it in any way support ASSUME, symbol
       typing, or MASM-style structures.

       To enable the package, use the directive:

       `%use masm'

       Currently, the MASM compatibility package emulates:

       (*) The `FLAT' and `OFFSET' keywords are recognized and ignored.

       (*) The `PTR' keyword signifies a memory reference, as if the
           argument had been put in square brackets:

            mov eax,[foo]               ; memory reference 
            mov eax,dword ptr foo       ; memory reference 
            mov eax,dword ptr flat:foo  ; memory reference 
            mov eax,offset foo          ; address 
            mov eax,foo                 ; address (ambiguous syntax in MASM)

       (*) The `SEGMENT' ... `ENDS' syntax:

          segname SEGMENT 
              ... 
          segname ENDS

       (*) The `PROC' ... `ENDP' syntax:

          procname PROC [FAR] 
               ... 
          procname ENDP

           `PROC' will also define `RET' as a macro expanding to either
           `RETF' if `FAR' is specified and `RETN' otherwise. Any keyword
           after `PROC' other than `FAR' is ignored.

       (*) The `TBYTE' keyword as an alias for `TWORD' (see section 2.2.7).

       (*) The `END' directive is ignored.

       (*) In 64-bit mode relative addressing is the default
           (`DEFAULT REL', see section 8.2.1).

       (*) A macro is defined to allow using the syntax `ST(0)' instead of
           `ST0' (and so on) for the x87 stack registers.

       In addition, NASM now natively supports, regardless of whether this
       package is used or not:

       (*) `?' and `DUP' syntax for the `DB' etc data declaration
           directives (see section 3.2.1).

       (*) `displacement[base+index]' syntax for memory operations, instead
           of `[base+index+displacement]'.

       (*) `seg:[addr]' instead of `[seg:addr]' syntax.

       (*) A pure offset can be given to `LEA' without square brackets:

            lea rax,[foo]               ; standard syntax 
            lea rax,foo                 ; also accepted

   7.6 `vtern': Ternary Logic Assist

       The `vtern' macro package allows for a simple and clear way of
       defining the immediate operand to the `VPTERNLOGD' and `VPTERNLOGQ'
       instructions. See section 4.5 for a description.

Chapter 8: Assembler Directives
-------------------------------

       NASM, though it attempts to avoid the bureaucracy of assemblers like
       MASM and TASM, is nevertheless forced to support a _few_ directives.
       These are described in this chapter.

       NASM's directives come in two types: _user-level_ directives and
       _primitive_ directives. Typically, each directive has a user-level
       form and a primitive form. In almost all cases, we recommend that
       users use the user-level forms of the directives, which are
       implemented as macros which call the primitive forms.

       Primitive directives are enclosed in square brackets; user-level
       directives are not.

       In addition to the universal directives described in this chapter,
       each object file format can optionally supply extra directives in
       order to control particular features of that file format. These
       _format-specific_ directives are documented along with the formats
       that implement them, in chapter 9.

   8.1 `BITS': Target Processor Mode

       The `BITS' directive specifies whether NASM should generate code
       designed to run on a processor operating in 16-bit mode, 32-bit mode
       or 64-bit mode. The syntax is `BITS XX', where XX is 16, 32 or 64.

       In most cases, you should not need to use `BITS' explicitly. The
       `aout', `coff', `elf*', `macho', `win32' and `win64' object formats,
       which are designed for use in 32-bit or 64-bit operating systems,
       all cause NASM to select 32-bit or 64-bit mode, respectively, by
       default. The `obj' object format allows you to specify each segment
       you define as either `USE16' or `USE32', and NASM will set its
       operating mode accordingly, so the use of the `BITS' directive is
       once again unnecessary.

       The most likely reason for using the `BITS' directive is to write
       32-bit or 64-bit code in a flat binary file; this is because the
       `bin' output format defaults to 16-bit mode in anticipation of it
       being used most frequently to write DOS `.COM' programs, DOS `.SYS'
       device drivers and boot loader software.

       The `BITS' directive can also be used to generate code for a
       different mode than the standard one for the output format.

       You do _not_ need to specify `BITS 32' merely in order to use 32-bit
       instructions in a 16-bit DOS program; if you do, the assembler will
       generate incorrect code because it will be writing code targeted at
       a 32-bit platform, to be run on a 16-bit one.

       When NASM is in `BITS 16' mode, instructions which use 32-bit data
       are prefixed with an 0x66 byte, and those referring to 32-bit
       addresses have an 0x67 prefix. In `BITS 32' mode, the reverse is
       true: 32-bit instructions require no prefixes, whereas instructions
       using 16-bit data need an 0x66 and those working on 16-bit addresses
       need an 0x67.

       When NASM is in `BITS 64' mode, most instructions operate the same
       as they do for `BITS 32' mode. However, there are 8 more general and
       SSE registers, and 16-bit addressing is no longer supported.

       The default address size is 64 bits; 32-bit addressing can be
       selected with the 0x67 prefix. The default operand size is still 32
       bits, however, and the 0x66 prefix selects 16-bit operand size. The
       `REX' prefix is used both to select 64-bit operand size, and to
       access the new registers. NASM automatically inserts REX prefixes
       when necessary.

       When the `REX' prefix is used, the processor does not know how to
       address the AH, BH, CH or DH (high 8-bit legacy) registers. Instead,
       it is possible to access the the low 8-bits of the SP, BP, SI and DI
       registers as SPL, BPL, SIL and DIL, respectively; but only when the
       REX prefix is used.

       The `BITS' directive has an exactly equivalent primitive form,
       `[BITS 16]', `[BITS 32]' and `[BITS 64]'. The user-level form is a
       macro which has no function other than to call the primitive form.

       Note that the space is necessary, e.g. `BITS32' will _not_ work!

 8.1.1 `USE16' & `USE32': Aliases for BITS

       The ``USE16'' and ``USE32'' directives can be used in place of
       ``BITS 16'' and ``BITS 32'', for compatibility with other
       assemblers.

   8.2 `DEFAULT': Change the assembler defaults

       The `DEFAULT' directive changes the assembler defaults. Normally,
       NASM defaults to a mode where the programmer is expected to
       explicitly specify most features directly. However, this is
       occasionally obnoxious, as the explicit form is pretty much the only
       one one wishes to use.

       Currently, `DEFAULT' can be used to select `RIP'-relative (`REL') or
       absolute (`ABS') addressing in 64-bit mode, and the use of MPX `BND'
       prefixes.

 8.2.1 `REL', `ABS': RIP-relative addressing

       This sets whether registerless instructions in 64-bit mode are
       `RIP'-relative or not. By default, they are absolute unless
       overridden with the `REL' specifier (see section 3.3). However, if
       `DEFAULT REL' is specified, `REL' is default, unless overridden with
       the `ABS' specifier, _except when used with an FS or GS segment
       override_.

       `DEFAULT REL' is disabled with `DEFAULT ABS'.

       The special handling of `FS' and `GS' overrides are due to the fact
       that these registers are generally used as thread pointers or other
       special functions in 64-bit mode, and generating `RIP'-relative
       addresses is not desired on most platforms.

       To specify that `FS'- or `GS'-relative addresses _should_ also be
       generated as `RIP'-relative, specify the `ABS' or `REL' keyword with
       an `FS:' or `GS:' prefix:

       DEFAULT REL, FS:ABS, GS:REL

       ... will make `FS'-relative references default to absolute, but all
       others, including `GS'-relative references, `RIP'-relative.

       `DEFAULT REL' is likely to become the default setting in a future
       version of NASM. Specify `DEFAULT ABS' explicitly if you need your
       code to avoid relative offsets.

 8.2.2 `BND', `NOBND': `BND' prefix

       If `DEFAULT BND' is set, all bnd-prefix available instructions
       following this directive are prefixed with bnd. To override it,
       `NOBND' prefix can be used.

        DEFAULT BND 
            call foo            ; BND will be prefixed 
            nobnd call foo      ; BND will NOT be prefixed

       `DEFAULT NOBND' can disable `DEFAULT BND' and then `BND' prefix will
       be added only when explicitly specified in code.

       `DEFAULT BND' is expected to be the normal configuration for writing
       MPX-enabled code.

   8.3 `SECTION' or `SEGMENT': Changing and Defining Sections

       The `SECTION' directive (`SEGMENT' is an exactly equivalent synonym)
       changes which section of the output file the code you write will be
       assembled into. In some object file formats, the number and names of
       sections are fixed; in others, the user may make up as many as they
       wish. Hence `SECTION' may sometimes give an error message, or may
       define a new section, if you try to switch to a section that does
       not (yet) exist.

       The Unix object formats, and the `bin' object format (but see
       section 9.1.3), all support the standardized section names `.text',
       `.data' and `.bss' for the code, data and uninitialized-data
       sections. The `obj' format, by contrast, does not recognize these
       section names as being special, and indeed will strip off the
       leading period of any section name that has one.

 8.3.1 The `__?SECT?__' Macro

       The `SECTION' directive is unusual in that its user-level form
       functions differently from its primitive form. The primitive form,
       `[SECTION xyz]', simply switches the current target section to the
       one given. The user-level form, `SECTION xyz', however, first
       defines the single-line macro `__?SECT?__' to be the primitive
       `[SECTION]' directive which it is about to issue, and then issues
       it. So the user-level directive

               SECTION .text

       expands to the two lines

       %define __?SECT?__        [SECTION .text] 
               [SECTION .text]

       Users may find it useful to make use of this in their own macros.
       For example, the `writefile' macro defined in section 5.5.3 can be
       usefully rewritten in the following more sophisticated form:

       %macro  writefile 2+ 
       
               [section .data] 
       
         %%str:        db      %2 
         %%endstr: 
       
               __?SECT?__ 
       
               mov     dx,%%str 
               mov     cx,%%endstr-%%str 
               mov     bx,%1 
               mov     ah,0x40 
               int     0x21 
       
       %endmacro

       This form of the macro, once passed a string to output, first
       switches temporarily to the data section of the file, using the
       primitive form of the `SECTION' directive so as not to modify
       `__?SECT?__'. It then declares its string in the data section, and
       then invokes `__?SECT?__' to switch back to _whichever_ section the
       user was previously working in. It thus avoids the need, in the
       previous version of the macro, to include a `JMP' instruction to
       jump over the data, and also does not fail if, in a complicated
       `OBJ' format module, the user could potentially be assembling the
       code in any of several separate code sections.

   8.4 `ABSOLUTE': Defining Absolute Labels

       The `ABSOLUTE' directive can be thought of as an alternative form of
       `SECTION': it causes the subsequent code to be directed at no
       physical section, but at the hypothetical section starting at the
       given absolute address. The only instructions you can use in this
       mode are the `RESB' family.

       `ABSOLUTE' is used as follows:

       absolute 0x1A 
       
           kbuf_chr    resw    1 
           kbuf_free   resw    1 
           kbuf        resw    16

       This example describes a section of the PC BIOS data area, at
       segment address 0x40: the above code defines `kbuf_chr' to be 0x1A,
       `kbuf_free' to be 0x1C, and `kbuf' to be 0x1E.

       The user-level form of `ABSOLUTE', like that of `SECTION', redefines
       the `__?SECT?__' macro when it is invoked.

       `STRUC' and `ENDSTRUC' are defined as macros which use `ABSOLUTE'
       (and also `__?SECT?__').

       `ABSOLUTE' doesn't have to take an absolute constant as an argument:
       it can take an expression (actually, a critical expression: see
       section 3.8) and it can be a value in a segment. For example, a TSR
       can re-use its setup code as run-time BSS like this:

               org     100h               ; it's a .COM program 
       
               jmp     setup              ; setup code comes last 
       
               ; the resident part of the TSR goes here 
       setup: 
               ; now write the code that installs the TSR here 
       
       absolute setup 
       
       runtimevar1     resw    1 
       runtimevar2     resd    20 
       
       tsr_end:

       This defines some variables `on top of' the setup code, so that
       after the setup has finished running, the space it took up can be
       re-used as data storage for the running TSR. The symbol `tsr_end'
       can be used to calculate the total size of the part of the TSR that
       needs to be made resident.

   8.5 `EXTERN': Importing Symbols from Other Modules

       `EXTERN' is similar to the MASM directive `EXTRN' and the C keyword
       `extern': it is used to declare a symbol which is not defined
       anywhere in the module being assembled, but is assumed to be defined
       in some other module and needs to be referred to by this one. Not
       every object-file format can support external variables: the `bin'
       format cannot.

       The `EXTERN' directive takes as many arguments as you like. Each
       argument is the name of a symbol:

       extern  _printf 
       extern  _sscanf,_fscanf

       Some object-file formats provide extra features to the `EXTERN'
       directive. In all cases, the extra features are used by suffixing a
       colon to the symbol name followed by object-format specific text.
       For example, the `obj' format allows you to declare that the default
       segment base of an external should be the group `dgroup' by means of
       the directive

       extern  _variable:wrt dgroup

       The primitive form of `EXTERN' differs from the user-level form only
       in that it can take only one argument at a time: the support for
       multiple arguments is implemented at the preprocessor level.

       You can declare the same variable as `EXTERN' more than once: NASM
       will quietly ignore the second and later redeclarations.

       If a variable is declared both `GLOBAL' and `EXTERN', or if it is
       declared as `EXTERN' and then defined, it will be treated as
       `GLOBAL'. If a variable is declared both as `COMMON' and `EXTERN',
       it will be treated as `COMMON'.

       Since NASM version 2.15, the `EXTERN' keyword (since version 2.15)
       does not request import of symbols that are never actually
       referenced in the code, as that prevents using common header files,
       as it might cause the linker to pull in a bunch of unnecessary
       modules. To unconditionally request import of external symbols, use
       the `REQUIRED' directive instead (see section 8.6).

       If the old behavior is required, rather than changing the source
       code, one can override the user macro definition:

       %ifmacro required      ; Test for NASM new enough to support REQUIRED 
         %unimacro extern 1-* 
         %imacro extern 1+.nolist 
            required %1 
         %endmacro 
       %endif

   8.6 `REQUIRED': Unconditionally Importing Symbols from Other Modules

       The `REQUIRED' keyword is similar to `EXTERN' one. The difference is
       that the `EXTERN' keyword (since version 2.15) does not request
       import of symbols that are never actually referenced in the code, as
       that prevents using common header files, as it might cause the
       linker to pull in a bunch of unnecessary modules.

   8.7 `GLOBAL': Exporting Symbols to Other Modules

       `GLOBAL' is the other end of `EXTERN': if one module declares a
       symbol as `EXTERN' and refers to it, then in order to prevent linker
       errors, some other module must actually _define_ the symbol and
       declare it as `GLOBAL'. Some assemblers use the name `PUBLIC' for
       this purpose.

       `GLOBAL' uses the same syntax as `EXTERN', except that it must refer
       to symbols which _are_ defined in the same module as the `GLOBAL'
       directive. For example:

       global _main 
       _main: 
               ; some code

       `GLOBAL', like `EXTERN', allows object formats to define private
       extensions by means of a colon. The ELF object format, for example,
       lets you specify whether global data items are functions or data:

       global  hashlookup:function, hashtable:data

       Like `EXTERN', the primitive form of `GLOBAL' differs from the user-
       level form only in that it can take only one argument at a time.

   8.8 `COMMON': Defining Common Data Areas

       The `COMMON' directive is used to declare _common variables_. A
       common variable is much like a global variable declared in the
       uninitialized data section, so that

       common  intvar  4

       is similar in function to

       global  intvar 
       section .bss 
       
       intvar  resd    1

       The difference is that if more than one module defines the same
       common variable, then at link time those variables will be _merged_,
       and references to `intvar' in all modules will point at the same
       piece of memory.

       Like `GLOBAL' and `EXTERN', `COMMON' supports object-format specific
       extensions. For example, the `obj' format allows common variables to
       be NEAR or FAR, and the ELF format allows you to specify the
       alignment requirements of a common variable:

       common  commvar  4:near  ; works in OBJ 
       common  intarray 100:4   ; works in ELF: 4 byte aligned

       Once again, like `EXTERN' and `GLOBAL', the primitive form of
       `COMMON' differs from the user-level form only in that it can take
       only one argument at a time.

   8.9 `STATIC': Local Symbols within Modules

       Opposite to `EXTERN' and `GLOBAL', `STATIC' is local symbol, but
       should be named according to the global mangling rules (named by
       analogy with the C keyword `static' as applied to functions or
       global variables).

       static foo 
       foo: 
                ; codes

       Unlike `GLOBAL', `STATIC' does not allow object formats to accept
       private extensions mentioned in section 8.7.

  8.10 `[[GL]PREFIX]', `[[GL]SUFFIX]': Mangling Symbols

       `[PREFIX]', `[GPREFIX]', `[LPREFIX]', `[SUFFIX]', `[GSUFFIX]', and
       `[LSUFFIX]' directives can prepend or append a string to a certain
       type of symbols, normally to fit specific ABI conventions

       (*) `[PREFIX]', `[GPREFIX]': Prepend the argument to all `EXTERN',
           `COMMON', `STATIC', and `GLOBAL' symbols.

       (*) `[LPREFIX': Prepend the argument to all other symbols such as
           local labels and backend defined symbols.

       (*) `[SUFFIX]', `[GSUFFIX]', `[POSTFIX]', `[GPOSTFIX]': Append the
           argument to all `EXTERN', `COMMON', `STATIC', and `GLOBAL'
           symbols.

       (*) `[LSUFFIX]', `[LPOSTFIX]': Append the argument to all other
           symbols such as local labels and backend defined symbols.

       These directives are also implemented as pragmas, and using
       `%pragma' syntax can be restricted to specific backends (see section
       5.12):

       %pragma macho lprefix L_

       Command line options are also available. See also section 2.1.28.

       One example which supports many ABIs:

       ; The most common conventions 
       %pragma output gprefix _ 
       %pragma output lprefix L_ 
       ; ELF uses a different convention 
       %pragma elf    gprefix                       ; empty 
       %pragma elf    lprefix .L

       Some toolchains is aware of a particular prefix for its own
       optimization options, such as dead code elimination. For instance,
       the Mach-O binary format has a linker convention that uses a
       simplistic naming scheme to chunk up sections into smaller
       subsections, each of which may be eliminated. When the
       `subsections_via_symbols' directive (section 9.9.4) is declared,
       each symbol is the start of a separate block. The subsection is,
       then, defined to include sections before the one that starts with a
       'L'. `[LPREFIX]' is useful here to mark all local symbols with the
       'L' prefix to be excluded to the meta section. It converts local
       symbols compatible with the particular toolchain. Note that local
       symbols declared with `STATIC' (section 8.9) are excluded from the
       symbol mangling and also not marked as global.

       Earlier versions of NASM called the pragmas `suffix' and the options
       `--postfix', and did not implement directives at all despite being
       so documented. Since NASM 3.01, the directive forms are implemented,
       and directives, pragmas and options all support all spellings.

  8.11 `CPU': Defining CPU Dependencies

       The `CPU' directive restricts assembly to those instructions which
       are available on the specified CPU. At the moment, it is primarily
       used to enforce unavailable _encodings_ of instructions, such as 5-
       byte jumps on the 8080.

       (If someone would volunteer to work through the database and add
       proper annotations to each instruction, this could be greatly
       improved. Please contact the developers to volunteer, see appendix
       E.)

       Current CPU keywords are:

       (*) `CPU 8086' - Assemble only 8086 instruction set

       (*) `CPU 186' - Assemble instructions up to the 80186 instruction
           set

       (*) `CPU 286' - Assemble instructions up to the 286 instruction set

       (*) `CPU 386' - Assemble instructions up to the 386 instruction set

       (*) `CPU 486' - 486 instruction set

       (*) `CPU 586' - Pentium instruction set

       (*) `CPU PENTIUM' - Same as 586

       (*) `CPU 686' - P6 instruction set

       (*) `CPU PPRO' - Same as 686

       (*) `CPU P2' - Same as 686

       (*) `CPU P3' - Pentium III (Katmai) instruction sets

       (*) `CPU KATMAI' - Same as P3

       (*) `CPU P4' - Pentium 4 (Willamette) instruction set

       (*) `CPU WILLAMETTE' - Same as P4

       (*) `CPU PRESCOTT' - Prescott instruction set

       (*) `CPU X64' - x86-64 (x64/AMD64/Intel 64) instruction set

       (*) `CPU IA64' - IA64 CPU (in x86 mode) instruction set

       (*) `CPU DEFAULT' - All available instructions

       (*) `CPU ALL' - All available instructions _and flags_

       All options are case insensitive.

       In addition, optional flags can be specified to modify the
       instruction selections. These can be combined with a CPU declaration
       or specified alone. They can be prefixed by `+' (add flag, default),
       `-' (remove flag) or `*' (set flag to default); these prefixes are
       "sticky", so:

            cpu -foo,bar

       means remove both the `foo' and `bar' options.

       If prefixed with `no', it inverts the meaning of the flag, but this
       is not sticky, so:

            cpu nofoo,bar

       means remove the `foo' flag but add the `bar' flag.

       Currently available flags are:

       (*) `EVEX' - Enable generation of EVEX (AVX-512) encoded
           instructions without an explicit `{evex}' prefix. Default on.

       (*) `VEX' - Enable generation of VEX (AVX) or XOP encoded
           instructions without an explict `{vex}' prefix. Default on.

       (*) `LATEVEX' - Enable generation of VEX (AVX) encoding of
           instructions where the VEX instructions forms were introduced
           _after_ the corresponding EVEX (AVX-512) instruction forms
           without requiring an explicit `{vex}' prefix. This is implicit
           if the `EVEX' flag is disabled and the `VEX' flag is enabled.
           Default off.

  8.12 `[DOLLARHEX]': Enable or disable `$' hexadecimal syntax

       Using a `$' prefix for hexadecimal numbers is deprecated, as it
       conflicts with the use of `$' for escaping symbols (see section
       3.4.1 and section 3.1). The `[DOLLARHEX]' directive can be used to
       disable it completely:

           [dollarhex off]

       When disabled, symbols beginning with digits can be escaped as well,
       e.g. `$3' would define a symbol `3'.

       No "user form" (without the brackets) currently exists.

  8.13 `FLOAT': Handling of floating-point constants

       By default, floating-point constants are rounded to nearest, and
       IEEE denormals are supported. The following options can be set to
       alter this behaviour:

       (*) `FLOAT DAZ' - Flush denormals to zero

       (*) `FLOAT NODAZ' - Do not flush denormals to zero (default)

       (*) `FLOAT NEAR' - Round to nearest (default)

       (*) `FLOAT UP' - Round up (toward +Infinity)

       (*) `FLOAT DOWN' - Round down (toward -Infinity)

       (*) `FLOAT ZERO' - Round toward zero

       (*) `FLOAT DEFAULT' - Restore default settings

       The standard macros `__?FLOAT_DAZ?__', `__?FLOAT_ROUND?__', and
       `__?FLOAT?__' contain the current state, as long as the programmer
       has avoided the use of the bracketed primitive form, (`[FLOAT]').

       `__?FLOAT?__' contains the full set of floating-point settings; this
       value can be saved away and invoked later to restore the setting.

  8.14 `[WARNING]': Enable or disable warnings

       The `[WARNING]' directive can be used to enable or disable classes
       of warnings in the same way as the `-w' option, see appendix A for
       more details about warning classes.

       (*) `[warning +'_warning-class_`]' enables warnings for
           _warning-class_.

       (*) `[warning -'_warning-class_`]' disables warnings for
           _warning-class_.

       (*) `[warning *'_warning-class_`]' restores _warning-class_ to the
           original value, either the default value or as specified on the
           command line.

       (*) `[warning push]' saves the current warning state on a stack.

       (*) `[warning pop]' restores the current warning state from the
           stack.

       The `[WARNING]' directive also accepts the `all', `error' and
       `error='_warning-class_ specifiers, see section 2.1.26.

       No "user form" (without the brackets) currently exists.

  8.15 `[LIST]': Locally disable list file output

       The `[LIST]' directive disables or re-enables list file output.

       (*) `[list -]' disables list file output.

       (*) `[list +]' re-enables list file output.

       The `[LIST]' directive can be overridden with the `-LF' command-line
       option, see section 2.1.4.

Chapter 9: Output Formats
-------------------------

       NASM is a portable assembler, designed to be able to compile on any
       ANSI C-supporting platform and produce output to run on a variety of
       Intel x86 operating systems. For this reason, it has a large number
       of available output formats, selected using the `-f' option on the
       NASM command line. Each of these formats, along with its extensions
       to the base NASM syntax, is detailed in this chapter.

       As stated in section 2.1.1, NASM chooses a default name for your
       output file based on the input file name and the chosen output
       format. This will be generated by removing the filename extension
       (`.asm', `.s', or whatever you like to use) from the input file
       name, and substituting an extension defined by the output format.
       The extensions are given with each format below.

   9.1 `bin': Flat-Form Binary Output

       The `bin' format does not produce object files: it generates nothing
       in the output file except the code you wrote. Such `pure binary'
       files are used by MS-DOS: `.COM' executables and `.SYS' device
       drivers are pure binary files. Pure binary output is also useful for
       operating system and boot loader development.

       The `bin' format supports multiple section names. For details of how
       NASM handles sections in the `bin' format, see section 9.1.3.

       Using the `bin' format puts NASM by default into 16-bit mode (see
       section 8.1). In order to use `bin' to write 32-bit or 64-bit code,
       such as an OS kernel, you need to explicitly issue the `BITS 32' or
       `BITS 64' directive.

       `bin' has no default output file name extension: instead, it leaves
       your file name as it is once the original extension has been
       removed. Thus, the default is for NASM to assemble `binprog.asm'
       into a binary file called `binprog'.

       It is extremely important to understand that the binary output
       format is simply nothing other than _a linker built into the NASM
       executable._ As such, NASM behaves just as it does when producing
       any other output format: notably the list file reflects the code
       output _before_ relocation, and the addresses in the list file are
       addresses relative to the start of the current output section.

 9.1.1 `ORG': Binary File Program Origin

       The `bin' format provides an additional directive to the list given
       in chapter 8: `ORG'. The function of the `ORG' directive is to
       specify the origin address which NASM will assume the program begins
       at when it is loaded into memory.

       For example, the following code will generate the longword
       `0x00000104':

               org     0x100 
               dd      label 
       label:

       Unlike the `ORG' directive provided by MASM-compatible assemblers,
       which allows you to jump around in the object file and overwrite
       code you have already generated, NASM's `ORG' does exactly what the
       directive says: _origin_. Its sole function is to specify one offset
       which is added to all internal address references within the
       section; it does not permit any of the trickery that MASM's version
       does. See section 14.1.3 for further comments.

 9.1.2 `bin' Extensions to the `SECTION' Directive

       The `bin' output format extends the `SECTION' (or `SEGMENT')
       directive to allow you to specify the alignment requirements of
       segments. This is done by appending the `ALIGN' qualifier to the end
       of the section-definition line. For example,

       section .data   align=16

       switches to the section `.data' and also specifies that it must be
       aligned on a 16-byte boundary.

       The parameter to `ALIGN' specifies how many low bits of the section
       start address must be forced to zero. The alignment value given may
       be any power of two.

 9.1.3 Multisection Support for the `bin' Format

       The `bin' format allows the use of multiple sections, of arbitrary
       names, besides the "known" `.text', `.data', and `.bss' names.

       (*) Sections may be designated `progbits' or `nobits'. Default is
           `progbits' (except `.bss', which defaults to `nobits', of
           course).

       (*) Sections can be aligned at a specified boundary following the
           previous section with `align=', or at an arbitrary byte-granular
           position with `start='.

       (*) Sections can be given a virtual start address, which will be
           used for the calculation of all memory references within that
           section with `vstart='.

       (*) Sections can be ordered using `follows='`<section>' or
           `vfollows='`<section>' as an alternative to specifying an
           explicit start address.

       (*) Arguments to `org', `start', `vstart', and `align=' are critical
           expressions. See section 3.8. For example, in the case of
           `align=(1 << ALIGN_SHIFT)', `ALIGN_SHIFT' must be defined before
           it is used here.

       (*) Any code which comes before an explicit `SECTION' directive is
           directed by default into the `.text' section.

       (*) If an `ORG' statement is not given, `ORG 0' is used by default.

       (*) The `.bss' section will be placed after the last `progbits'
           section, unless `start=', `vstart=', `follows=', or `vfollows='
           has been specified.

       (*) All sections are aligned on dword boundaries, unless a different
           alignment has been specified.

       (*) Sections may not overlap.

       (*) NASM creates the `section.<secname>.start' for each section,
           which may be used in your code.

 9.1.4 Map Files

       Map files can be generated in `-f bin' format by means of the
       `[map]' option. Map types of `all' (default), `brief', `sections',
       `segments', or `symbols' may be specified. Output may be directed to
       `stdout' (default), `stderr', or a specified file. E.g.
       `[map symbols myfile.map]'. No "user form" exists, the square
       brackets must be used.

   9.2 `ith': Intel Hex Output

       The `ith' file format produces Intel hex-format files. Just as the
       `bin' format, this is a flat memory image format with no support for
       further relocation or linking. It is usually used with ROM
       programmers and similar utilities.

       From a programmer point of view, this behaves identically to the
       `.bin' format; the only difference is the encoding of the output.
       All extensions supported by the `bin' file format is also supported
       by the `ith' file format.

       `ith' provides a default output file-name extension of `.ith'.

   9.3 `srec': Motorola S-Records Output

       The `srec' file format produces Motorola S-records files. Just as
       the `bin' format, this is a flat memory image format with no support
       for relocation or linking. It is usually used with ROM programmers
       and similar utilities.

       From a programmer point of view, this behaves identically to the
       `.bin' format; the only difference is the encoding of the output.
       All extensions supported by the `bin' file format is also supported
       by the `srec' file format.

       `srec' provides a default output file-name extension of `.srec'.

   9.4 `obj': Microsoft OMF Object Files

       The `obj' file format (NASM calls it `obj' rather than `omf' for
       historical reasons) is the one produced by MASM and TASM, which is
       typically fed to 16-bit DOS linkers to produce `.EXE' files. It is
       also the format used by OS/2.

       `obj' provides a default output file-name extension of `.obj'.

       `obj' is not exclusively a 16-bit format, though; NASM has full
       support for the 32-bit extensions to the format. In particular, 32-
       bit `obj' format files are used by Borland's Win32 compilers,
       instead of using Microsoft's newer `win32' object file format.

       The `obj' format does not define any special segment names: you can
       call your segments anything you like. Typical names for segments in
       `obj' format files are `CODE', `DATA' and `BSS'.

       If your source file contains code before specifying an explicit
       `SEGMENT' directive, then NASM will invent its own segment called
       `__NASMDEFSEG' for you.

       When you define a segment in an `obj' file, NASM defines the segment
       name as a symbol as well, so that you can access the segment address
       of the segment. So, for example:

       segment data 
       
       dvar:   dw      1234 
       
       segment code 
       
       function: 
               mov     ax,data         ; get segment address of data 
               mov     ds,ax           ; and move it into DS 
               inc     word [dvar]     ; now this reference will work 
               ret

       The `obj' format also enables the use of the `SEG' and `WRT'
       operators, so that you can write code which does things like

       extern  foo 
       
             mov   ax,seg foo            ; get preferred segment of foo 
             mov   ds,ax 
             mov   ax,data               ; a different segment 
             mov   es,ax 
             mov   ax,[ds:foo]           ; this accesses `foo' 
             mov   [es:foo wrt data],bx  ; so does this

 9.4.1 `obj' Extensions to the `SEGMENT' Directive

       The `obj' output format extends the `SEGMENT' (or `SECTION')
       directive to allow you to specify various properties of the segment
       you are defining. This is done by appending extra qualifiers to the
       end of the segment-definition line. For example,

       segment code private align=16

       defines the segment `code', but also declares it to be a private
       segment, and requires that the portion of it described in this code
       module must be aligned on a 16-byte boundary.

       The available qualifiers are:

       (*) `PRIVATE', `PUBLIC', `COMMON' and `STACK' specify the
           combination characteristics of the segment. `PRIVATE' segments
           do not get combined with any others by the linker; `PUBLIC' and
           `STACK' segments get concatenated together at link time; and
           `COMMON' segments all get overlaid on top of each other rather
           than stuck end-to-end.

       (*) `ALIGN' is used, as shown above, to specify how many low bits of
           the segment start address must be forced to zero. The alignment
           value given may be any power of two from 1 to 4096; in reality,
           the only values supported are 1, 2, 4, 16, 256 and 4096, so if 8
           is specified it will be rounded up to 16, and 32, 64 and 128
           will all be rounded up to 256, and so on. Note that alignment to
           4096-byte boundaries is a PharLap extension to the format and
           may not be supported by all linkers.

       (*) `CLASS' can be used to specify the segment class; this feature
           indicates to the linker that segments of the same class should
           be placed near each other in the output file. The class name can
           be any word, e.g. `CLASS=CODE'.

       (*) `OVERLAY', like `CLASS', is specified with an arbitrary word as
           an argument, and provides overlay information to an overlay-
           capable linker.

       (*) Segments can be declared as `USE16' or `USE32', which has the
           effect of recording the choice in the object file and also
           ensuring that NASM's default assembly mode when assembling in
           that segment is 16-bit or 32-bit respectively.

       (*) When writing OS/2 object files, you should declare 32-bit
           segments as `FLAT', which causes the default segment base for
           anything in the segment to be the special group `FLAT', and also
           defines the group if it is not already defined.

       (*) The `obj' file format also allows segments to be declared as
           having a pre-defined absolute segment address, although no
           linkers are currently known to make sensible use of this
           feature; nevertheless, NASM allows you to declare a segment such
           as `SEGMENT SCREEN ABSOLUTE=0xB800' if you need to. The
           `ABSOLUTE' and `ALIGN' keywords are mutually exclusive.

       NASM's default segment attributes are `PUBLIC', `ALIGN=1', no class,
       no overlay, and `USE16'.

 9.4.2 `GROUP': Defining Groups of Segments

       The `obj' format also allows segments to be grouped, so that a
       single segment register can be used to refer to all the segments in
       a group. NASM therefore supplies the `GROUP' directive, whereby you
       can code

       segment data 
       
               ; some data 
       
       segment bss 
       
               ; some uninitialized data 
       
       group dgroup data bss

       which will define a group called `dgroup' to contain the segments
       `data' and `bss'. Like `SEGMENT', `GROUP' causes the group name to
       be defined as a symbol, so that you can refer to a variable `var' in
       the `data' segment as `var wrt data' or as `var wrt dgroup',
       depending on which segment value is currently in your segment
       register.

       If you just refer to `var', however, and `var' is declared in a
       segment which is part of a group, then NASM will default to giving
       you the offset of `var' from the beginning of the _group_, not the
       _segment_. Therefore `SEG var', also, will return the group base
       rather than the segment base.

       NASM will allow a segment to be part of more than one group, but
       will generate a warning if you do this. Variables declared in a
       segment which is part of more than one group will default to being
       relative to the first group that was defined to contain the segment.

       A group does not have to contain any segments; you can still make
       `WRT' references to a group which does not contain the variable you
       are referring to. OS/2, for example, defines the special group
       `FLAT' with no segments in it.

       `GROUP' is cumulative. The above example can be done like this:

       group dgroup data 
       group dgroup bss

 9.4.3 `UPPERCASE': Disabling Case Sensitivity in Output

       Although NASM itself is case sensitive, some OMF linkers are not;
       therefore it can be useful for NASM to output single-case object
       files. The `UPPERCASE' format-specific directive causes all segment,
       group and symbol names that are written to the object file to be
       forced to upper case just before being written. Within a source
       file, NASM is still case-sensitive; but the object file can be
       written entirely in upper case if desired.

       `UPPERCASE' is used alone on a line; it requires no parameters.

 9.4.4 `IMPORT': Importing DLL Symbols

       The `IMPORT' format-specific directive defines a symbol to be
       imported from a DLL, for use if you are writing a DLL's import
       library in NASM. You still need to declare the symbol as `EXTERN' as
       well as using the `IMPORT' directive.

       The `IMPORT' directive takes two required parameters, separated by
       white space, which are (respectively) the name of the symbol you
       wish to import and the name of the library you wish to import it
       from. For example:

           import  WSAStartup wsock32.dll

       A third optional parameter gives the name by which the symbol is
       known in the library you are importing it from, in case this is not
       the same as the name you wish the symbol to be known by to your code
       once you have imported it. For example:

           import  asyncsel wsock32.dll WSAAsyncSelect

 9.4.5 `EXPORT': Exporting DLL Symbols

       The `EXPORT' format-specific directive defines a global symbol to be
       exported as a DLL symbol, for use if you are writing a DLL in NASM.
       You still need to declare the symbol as `GLOBAL' as well as using
       the `EXPORT' directive.

       `EXPORT' takes one required parameter, which is the name of the
       symbol you wish to export, as it was defined in your source file. An
       optional second parameter (separated by white space from the first)
       gives the _external_ name of the symbol: the name by which you wish
       the symbol to be known to programs using the DLL. If this name is
       the same as the internal name, you may leave the second parameter
       off.

       Further parameters can be given to define attributes of the exported
       symbol. These parameters, like the second, are separated by white
       space. If further parameters are given, the external name must also
       be specified, even if it is the same as the internal name. The
       available attributes are:

       (*) `resident' indicates that the exported name is to be kept
           resident by the system loader. This is an optimization for
           frequently used symbols imported by name.

       (*) `nodata' indicates that the exported symbol is a function which
           does not make use of any initialized data.

       (*) `parm=NNN', where `NNN' is an integer, sets the number of
           parameter words for the case in which the symbol is a call gate
           between 32-bit and 16-bit segments.

       (*) An attribute which is just a number indicates that the symbol
           should be exported with an identifying number (ordinal), and
           gives the desired number.

       For example:

           export  myfunc 
           export  myfunc TheRealMoreFormalLookingFunctionName 
           export  myfunc myfunc 1234  ; export by ordinal 
           export  myfunc myfunc resident parm=23 nodata

 9.4.6 `..start': Defining the Program Entry Point

       `OMF' linkers require exactly one of the object files being linked
       to define the program entry point, where execution will begin when
       the program is run. If the object file that defines the entry point
       is assembled using NASM, you specify the entry point by declaring
       the special symbol `..start' at the point where you wish execution
       to begin.

 9.4.7 `obj' Extensions to the `EXTERN' Directive

       If you declare an external symbol with the directive

           extern  foo

       then references such as `mov ax,foo' will give you the offset of
       `foo' from its preferred segment base (as specified in whichever
       module `foo' is actually defined in). So to access the contents of
       `foo' you will usually need to do something like

               mov     ax,seg foo      ; get preferred segment base 
               mov     es,ax           ; move it into ES 
               mov     ax,[es:foo]     ; and use offset `foo' from it

       This is a little unwieldy, particularly if you know that an external
       is going to be accessible from a given segment or group, say
       `dgroup'. So if `DS' already contained `dgroup', you could simply
       code

               mov     ax,[foo wrt dgroup]

       However, having to type this every time you want to access `foo' can
       be a pain; so NASM allows you to declare `foo' in the alternative
       form

           extern  foo:wrt dgroup

       This form causes NASM to pretend that the preferred segment base of
       `foo' is in fact `dgroup'; so the expression `seg foo' will now
       return `dgroup', and the expression `foo' is equivalent to
       `foo wrt dgroup'.

       This default-`WRT' mechanism can be used to make externals appear to
       be relative to any group or segment in your program. It can also be
       applied to common variables: see section 9.4.8.

 9.4.8 `obj' Extensions to the `COMMON' Directive

       The `obj' format allows common variables to be either near or far;
       NASM allows you to specify which your variables should be by the use
       of the syntax

       common  nearvar 2:near   ; `nearvar' is a near common 
       common  farvar  10:far   ; and `farvar' is far

       Far common variables may be greater in size than 64Kb, and so the
       OMF specification says that they are declared as a number of
       _elements_ of a given size. So a 10-byte far common variable could
       be declared as ten one-byte elements, five two-byte elements, two
       five-byte elements or one ten-byte element.

       Some `OMF' linkers require the element size, as well as the variable
       size, to match when resolving common variables declared in more than
       one module. Therefore NASM must allow you to specify the element
       size on your far common variables. This is done by the following
       syntax:

       common  c_5by2  10:far 5        ; two five-byte elements 
       common  c_2by5  10:far 2        ; five two-byte elements

       If no element size is specified, the default is 1. Also, the `FAR'
       keyword is not required when an element size is specified, since
       only far commons may have element sizes at all. So the above
       declarations could equivalently be

       common  c_5by2  10:5            ; two five-byte elements 
       common  c_2by5  10:2            ; five two-byte elements

       In addition to these extensions, the `COMMON' directive in `obj'
       also supports default-`WRT' specification like `EXTERN' does
       (explained in section 9.4.7). So you can also declare things like

       common  foo     10:wrt dgroup 
       common  bar     16:far 2:wrt data 
       common  baz     24:wrt data:6

 9.4.9 Embedded File Dependency Information

       Since NASM 2.13.02, `obj' files contain embedded dependency file
       information. To suppress the generation of dependencies, use

       %pragma obj nodepend

   9.5 `obj2': OS/2 32-bit OMF Object Files

       The `obj2' output format is the same as `obj' except:

       (*) Default attributes for a segment are `ALIGN=16' and `USE32'.

       (*) All 32-bit segment is added to `FLAT' group implicitly.

       (*) Support Unix sections such as `.text', `.rodata', `.data' and
           `.bss' for compatibility with other Unix platforms. And they are
           aliased to `TEXT32', `CONST32', `DATA32', `BSS32', respectively.

       (*) Set default classes implicitly for known segments such as
           TEXT32, CONST32, DATA32, BSS32 and so on.

       The defaults assumed by NASM if you do not specify the qualifiers
       are:

   9.6 `win32': Microsoft Win32 Object Files

       The `win32' output format generates Microsoft Win32 object files,
       suitable for passing to Microsoft linkers such as Visual C++. Note
       that Borland Win32 compilers do not use this format, but use `obj'
       instead (see section 9.4).

       `win32' provides a default output file-name extension of `.obj'.

       Note that although Microsoft say that Win32 object files follow the
       `COFF' (Common Object File Format) standard, the object files
       produced by Microsoft Win32 compilers are not compatible with COFF
       linkers such as DJGPP's, and vice versa. This is due to a difference
       of opinion over the precise semantics of PC-relative relocations. To
       produce COFF files suitable for DJGPP, use NASM's `coff' output
       format; conversely, the `coff' format does not produce object files
       that Win32 linkers can generate correct output from.

 9.6.1 `win32' Extensions to the `SECTION' Directive

       Like the `obj' format, `win32' allows you to specify additional
       information on the `SECTION' directive line, to control the type and
       properties of sections you declare. Section types and properties are
       generated automatically by NASM for the standard section names
       `.text', `.data' and `.bss', but may still be overridden by these
       qualifiers.

       The available qualifiers are:

       (*) `code', or equivalently `text', defines the section to be a code
           section. This marks the section as readable and executable, but
           not writable, and also indicates to the linker that the type of
           the section is code.

       (*) `data' and `bss' define the section to be a data section,
           analogously to `code'. Data sections are marked as readable and
           writable, but not executable. `data' declares an initialized
           data section, whereas `bss' declares an uninitialized data
           section.

       (*) `rdata' declares an initialized data section that is readable
           but not writable. Microsoft compilers use this section to place
           constants in it.

       (*) `info' defines the section to be an informational section, which
           is not included in the executable file by the linker, but may
           (for example) pass information _to_ the linker. For example,
           declaring an `info'-type section called `.drectve' causes the
           linker to interpret the contents of the section as command-line
           options.

       (*) `align=', used with a trailing number as in `obj', gives the
           alignment requirements of the section. The maximum you may
           specify is 64: the Win32 object file format contains no means to
           request a greater section alignment than this. If alignment is
           not explicitly specified, the defaults are 16-byte alignment for
           code sections, 8-byte alignment for rdata sections and 4-byte
           alignment for data (and BSS) sections. Informational sections
           get a default alignment of 1 byte (no alignment), though the
           value does not matter.

       (*) `comdat=', followed by a number ("selection"), colon (acting as
           a separator) and a name, marks the section as a "COMDAT
           section". It allows Microsoft linkers to perform function-level
           linking, to deal with multiply defined symbols, to eliminate
           dead code/data.

       The "selection" number should be one of the `IMAGE_COMDAT_SELECT_*'
       constants from `COFF format specification'; this value controls if
       the linker allows multiply defined symbols and how it handles them.

       The name is the "COMDAT symbol" - basically a new name for the
       section. So even though you have one section given by the main name
       (e.g. `.text'), it can actually consist of hundreds of COMDAT
       sections having their own name (and alignment).

       When the "selection" is IMAGE_COMDAT_SELECT_ASSOCIATIVE (5), the
       following name is the "COMDAT symbol" of the associated COMDAT
       section; this way you can link a piece of code or data only when
       another piece of code or data gets actually linked.

           So, when linking a NASM-compiled file with some C code, the
           source may be structured as follows. Note that the default
           `.text' section in handled in a special way and it doesn't work
           well with `comdat'; you may want to append a `$' character and
           an arbitrary suffix to the section name. It will get linked into
           the `.text' section anyway - see the info on `Grouped Sections'.

          section .text$1 align=16 comdat=1:FirstFnc 
             ...            ; Code linked only if referenced from C 
       
          section .text$1 align=16 comdat=1:SecondFnc 
             ...            ; Code linked only if referenced from C 
       
          section .rdata align=32 comdat=5:FirstFnc 
             ...            ; Data linked onlyif the related code 
                            ; (FirstFnc) is linked 

       The defaults assumed by NASM if you do not specify the above
       qualifiers are:

       section .text    code  align=16 
       section .data    data  align=4 
       section .rdata   rdata align=8 
       section .bss     bss   align=4

       The `win64' format also adds:

       section .pdata   rdata align=4 
       section .xdata   rdata align=8

       Any other section name is treated by default like `.text'.

 9.6.2 `win32': Safe Structured Exception Handling

       Among other improvements in Windows XP SP2 and Windows Server 2003,
       Microsoft has introduced the concept of "safe structured exception
       handling." The general idea is to collect handlers' entry points in
       a designated read-only table and have SEH entry points verified
       against this table before exception control is passed to the
       corresponding handler. In order for an executable module to be
       equipped with this read-only table, all object modules on linker
       command line have to comply with certain criteria. If even a single
       module among them does not, then the table in question is omitted
       and above mentioned run-time checks will not be performed for the
       application in question. Table omission is silent by default and
       therefore can be easily missed. One can instruct the linker to
       refuse to produce binary without such table by passing the
       `/safeseh' command line option.

       Without regard to this run-time check, it's natural to expect NASM
       to be capable of generating modules suitable for `/safeseh' linking.
       From the developer's viewpoint the problem is two-fold:

       (*) how to adapt modules not deploying exception handlers of their
           own;

       (*) how to adapt/develop modules utilizing custom exception
           handling;

       The former can be easily achieved with any NASM version by adding
       the following line to the source code:

       $@feat.00 equ 1

       As of version 2.03 NASM adds this absolute symbol automatically, if
       it is not already present (in which case the developer can choose to
       assign another value, if desired, for whatever reason).

       Registering a custom exception handler on the other hand requires
       certain "magic." As of version 2.03, an additional `safeseh'
       directive is implemented, which instructs the assembler to produce
       appropriately formatted input data for the above-mentioned "safe
       exception handler table." Its typical use would be:

       section .text 
       extern  _MessageBoxA@16 
       %if     __?NASM_VERSION_ID?__ >= 0x02030000 
       safeseh handler         ; register handler as "safe handler" 
       %endif 
       handler: 
               push    DWORD 1 ; MB_OKCANCEL 
               push    DWORD caption 
               push    DWORD text 
               push    DWORD 0 
               call    _MessageBoxA@16 
               sub     eax,1   ; incidentally suits as return value 
                               ; for exception handler 
               ret 
       global  _main 
       _main: 
               push    DWORD handler 
               push    DWORD [fs:0] 
               mov     DWORD [fs:0],esp ; engage exception handler 
               xor     eax,eax 
               mov     eax,DWORD[eax]   ; cause exception 
               pop     DWORD [fs:0]     ; disengage exception handler 
               add     esp,4 
               ret 
       text:   db      'OK to rethrow, CANCEL to generate core dump',0 
       caption:db      'SEGV',0 
       
       section .drectve info 
               db      '/defaultlib:user32.lib /defaultlib:msvcrt.lib '

       As you might imagine, it's perfectly possible to produce an .exe
       binary with the "safe exception handler table" and yet invoke an
       unregistered exception handler. A handler is invoked by manipulating
       `[fs:0]' at run-time, something the linker has no power over. It is
       therefore important to note that such failure to register a
       handler's entry point with the `safeseh' directive will have
       undesired side effects at run-time. If an exception is raised and an
       unregistered handler is to be executed, the application is abruptly
       terminated without any notification whatsoever. One can argue that
       the system should at least log some kind of "non-safe exception
       handler in x.exe at address n" message in the event log, but
       unfortunately the user is left without any clue as to what might
       have caused the crash.

       Finally, all mentions of linker in this paragraph refer to Microsoft
       linker version 7.x and later. Presence of `@feat.00' symbol and
       input data for "safe exception handler table" causes no backward
       incompatibilities and "safeseh" modules generated by NASM 2.03 and
       later can still be linked by earlier versions or non-Microsoft
       linkers.

 9.6.3 Debugging formats for Windows 

       The `win32' and `win64' formats support the Microsoft CodeView
       debugging format. Currently CodeView version 8 format is supported
       (`cv8'), but newer versions of the CodeView debugger should be able
       to handle this format as well.

   9.7 `win64': Microsoft Win64 Object Files

       The `win64' output format generates Microsoft Win64 object files,
       which is nearly 100% identical to the `win32' object format (section
       9.6) with the exception that it is meant to target 64-bit code and
       the x86-64 platform altogether. This object file is used exactly the
       same as the `win32' object format (section 9.6), in NASM, with
       regard to this exception.

 9.7.1 `win64': Writing Position-Independent Code

       While `REL' takes good care of RIP-relative addressing, there is one
       aspect that is easy to overlook for a Win64 programmer: indirect
       references. Consider a switch dispatch table:

               jmp     qword [dsptch+rax*8] 
               ... 
       dsptch: dq      case0 
               dq      case1 
               ...

       Even a novice Win64 assembler programmer will soon realize that the
       code is not 64-bit savvy. Most notably the linker will refuse to
       link it, showing:

       'ADDR32' relocation to '.text' invalid without /LARGEADDRESSAWARE:NO

       So [s]he will have to split jmp instruction as following:

               lea     rbx,[rel dsptch] 
               jmp     qword [rbx+rax*8]

       What happens behind the scenes is that the effective address in
       `lea' is encoded relative to instruction pointer, in a perfectly
       position-independent manner. But this is only part of the problem!
       The issue is that in a .dll context, the `caseN' relocations will
       make their way to the final module and might have to be adjusted at
       .dll load time (specifically, when it can't be loaded at the
       preferred address). When this occurs, pages with such relocations
       will be rendered private to current process, which kind of
       undermines the idea of a shared .dll. But not to worry, it's trivial
       to fix:

               lea     rbx,[rel dsptch] 
               add     rbx,[rbx+rax*8] 
               jmp     rbx 
               ... 
       dsptch: dq      case0-dsptch 
               dq      case1-dsptch 
               ...

       NASM version 2.03 and later provides another alternative,
       `wrt ..imagebase' operator, which returns an offset from base
       address of the current image, be it .exe or .dll module, hence the
       name. For those acquainted with PE-COFF format, this base address
       denotes the start of the `IMAGE_DOS_HEADER' structure. Here is how
       to implement a switch statement with these image-relative
       references:

               lea     rbx,[rel dsptch] 
               mov     eax,[rbx+rax*4] 
               sub     rbx,dsptch wrt ..imagebase 
               add     rbx,rax 
               jmp     rbx 
               ... 
       dsptch: dd      case0 wrt ..imagebase 
               dd      case1 wrt ..imagebase

       That said, the snippet before last works just fine with any NASM
       version and is not even Windows specific, which makes this operator
       unnecessary in this case. The real reason for the `wrt ..imagebase'
       operator will become apparent in the next section.

       It should be noted that `wrt ..imagebase' is defined as 32-bit
       operand only:

               dd      label wrt ..imagebase           ; ok 
               dq      label wrt ..imagebase           ; bad 
               mov     eax,label wrt ..imagebase       ; ok 
               mov     rax,label wrt ..imagebase       ; bad

 9.7.2 `win64': Structured Exception Handling

       Structured exception handing in Win64 is completely different
       compared to Win32. When an exception occurs, the program counter is
       noted, and a linker-generated table containing start and end
       addresses of all the functions (in a given executable module) is
       traversed and compared to the saved program counter. This is used to
       identify the corresponding `UNWIND_INFO' structure. If missing, then
       the offending subroutine is assumed to be "leaf" and this lookup
       procedure is instead attempted for its caller. In Win64, a leaf
       function is a function that does not call any other functions _nor_
       modifies any Win64 non-volatile registers, including the stack
       pointer. The latter ensures that it's possible to identify a leaf
       function's caller by simply pulling the value from the top of the
       stack.

       While the majority of subroutines written in assembler are not
       calling any other functions, they may not qualify as "leaf"
       functions in the Win64 sense. The requirement for non-volatile
       registers to be unchanged leaves the developer with not more than 7
       registers and no stack frame, which is not necessarily what they
       counted on. Customarily one would meet this requirement by saving
       non-volatile registers on stack and restoring them upon return.
       However, if (and only if) an exception is raised at run-time and no
       `UNWIND_INFO' structure is associated with such a "leaf" function,
       the stack unwind procedure will expect to find the caller's return
       address on the top of the stack immediately followed by its frame.
       Given that the developer pushed the caller's non-volatile registers
       onto the stack, the value on top will no longer point to the right
       place. The developer can attempt to copy the caller's return address
       to the top of stack, which would work in some very specific
       circumstances. But unless the developer can guarantee that these
       circumstances are always met, it's more appropriate to assume the
       worst, i.e. the stack unwind procedure goes berserk, abruptly
       terminating without any notification whatsoever (just like in the
       the Win32 case).

       Now that we understand significance of the `UNWIND_INFO' structure,
       let us discuss what is in it and how it is processed. First, it is
       checked for the presence of a reference to a custom language-
       specific exception handler. If there is one, then it is invoked.
       Depending on the return value, execution flow is resumed (exception
       is said to be "handled"), _or_ the rest of the `UNWIND_INFO'
       structure is processed as follows. Aside from an optional reference
       to a custom handler, it carries information about the current
       callee's stack frame and where non-volatile registers are saved. The
       information is detailed enough to be able to reconstruct the
       contents of the caller's non-volatile registers on entry to the
       current callee. And so the caller's context is reconstructed, at
       which point the unwind procedure is repeated, using the
       `UNWIND_INFO' structure associated with the caller's instruction
       pointer. The procedure is repeated recursively until the exception
       is handled. As a last resort, the system "handles" it by generating
       a memory dump and terminating the application.

       As of this writing, NASM unfortunately does not facilitate
       generation of above mentioned detailed information about stack frame
       layout. But as of version 2.03, it implements building blocks for
       generating structures involved in stack unwinding. Here is a simple
       example showing how to deploy a custom exception handler for a leaf
       function:

       default rel 
       section .text 
       extern  MessageBoxA 
       handler: 
               sub     rsp,40 
               mov     rcx,0 
               lea     rdx,[text] 
               lea     r8,[caption] 
               mov     r9,1    ; MB_OKCANCEL 
               call    MessageBoxA 
               sub     eax,1   ; incidentally suits as return value 
                               ; for exception handler 
               add     rsp,40 
               ret 
       global  main 
       main: 
               xor     rax,rax 
               mov     rax,QWORD[rax]  ; cause exception 
               ret 
       main_end: 
       text:   db      'OK to rethrow, CANCEL to generate core dump',0 
       caption:db      'SEGV',0 
       
       section .pdata  rdata align=4 
               dd      main wrt ..imagebase 
               dd      main_end wrt ..imagebase 
               dd      xmain wrt ..imagebase 
       section .xdata  rdata align=8 
       xmain:  db      9,0,0,0 
               dd      handler wrt ..imagebase 
       section .drectve info 
               db      '/defaultlib:user32.lib /defaultlib:msvcrt.lib '

       What you see is that the `.pdata' section contains a single-element
       table, containing function start and end addresses, along with
       references to associated `UNWIND_INFO' structures (only one in this
       case). The `.xdata' section contains the referenced `UNWIND_INFO'
       structure, describing a function with no frame, but with a
       designated exception handler. These references are _required_ to be
       image-relative, which is the real reason for implementing the
       `wrt ..imagebase' operator). It should be noted that
       `rdata align=n', as well as `wrt ..imagebase', are actually optional
       in the context of these two segments (they apply even when omitted);
       _all_ 32-bit references placed into these two segments will be
       image-relative. This is important to understand, as the developer is
       allowed to append handler-specific data to the `UNWIND_INFO'
       structure, and any 32-bit references that are added may require
       adjustment to obtain the real pointer.

       As already mentioned, in Win64 terms, a leaf function is one that
       neither calls any other function _nor_ modifies any non-volatile
       registers, including the stack pointer. But it is not uncommon for
       the programmer to intend to utilize every single register and
       sometimes even have a variable stack frame, requiring a more
       complicated `UNWIND_INFO' structure than in the example above. Is
       there anything one can do with these simpler building blocks, and
       avoid manually composing fully-fledged `UNWIND_INFO' structures,
       which would surely be considered error-prone? Yes, there is. Recall
       that an exception handler is called first, before the stack layout
       is analyzed. As it turns out, it is perfectly possible to manipulate
       current callee's context in a custom handler in a manner that
       permits further stack unwinding. The general idea is that handler
       would not actually "handle" the exception, but instead restore the
       callee's context (restore to state at entry point) and thus mimic a
       Win64 leaf function. In other words, the handler would effectively
       undertake part of the unwinding procedure. Consider the following
       example:

       function: 
               mov     rax,rsp         ; copy rsp to volatile register 
               push    r15             ; save non-volatile registers 
               push    rbx 
               push    rbp 
               mov     r11,rsp         ; prepare variable stack frame 
               sub     r11,rcx 
               and     r11,-64 
               mov     QWORD[r11],rax  ; check for exceptions 
               mov     rsp,r11         ; allocate stack frame 
               mov     QWORD[rsp],rax  ; save original rsp value 
       magic_point: 
               ... 
               mov     r11,QWORD[rsp]  ; pull original rsp value 
               mov     rbp,QWORD[r11-24] 
               mov     rbx,QWORD[r11-16] 
               mov     r15,QWORD[r11-8] 
               mov     rsp,r11         ; destroy frame 
               ret

       The key is that until `magic_point', the original `rsp' value
       remains in the chosen volatile register, and no non-volatile
       register except for `rsp' is modified. After `magic_point', `rsp'
       remains constant till the very end of the `function'. In this case a
       custom language-specific exception handler would look like this:

       EXCEPTION_DISPOSITION handler (EXCEPTION_RECORD *rec,ULONG64 frame, 
               CONTEXT *context,DISPATCHER_CONTEXT *disp) 
       {   ULONG64 *rsp; 
           if (context->Rip<(ULONG64)magic_point) 
               rsp = (ULONG64 *)context->Rax; 
           else 
           {   rsp = ((ULONG64 **)context->Rsp)[0]; 
               context->Rbp = rsp[-3]; 
               context->Rbx = rsp[-2]; 
               context->R15 = rsp[-1]; 
           } 
           context->Rsp = (ULONG64)rsp; 
       
           memcpy (disp->ContextRecord,context,sizeof(CONTEXT)); 
           RtlVirtualUnwind(UNW_FLAG_NHANDLER,disp->ImageBase, 
               dips->ControlPc,disp->FunctionEntry,disp->ContextRecord, 
               &disp->HandlerData,&disp->EstablisherFrame,NULL); 
           return ExceptionContinueSearch; 
       }

       As this custom handler allows the example function to mimic a Win64
       leaf function, the corresponding `UNWIND_INFO' structure does not
       need to contain any information about the stack frame and its
       layout.

   9.8 `coff': Common Object File Format

       The `coff' output type produces `COFF' object files suitable for
       linking with the DJGPP linker.

       `coff' provides a default output file-name extension of `.o'.

       The `coff' format supports the same extensions to the `SECTION'
       directive as `win32' does, except that the `align' qualifier and the
       `info' section type are not supported.

   9.9 `macho32' and `macho64': Mach Object File Format

       The `macho32' and `macho64' output formts produces Mach-O object
       files suitable for linking with the MacOS X linker. `macho' is a
       synonym for `macho32'.

       `macho' provides a default output file-name extension of `.o'.

 9.9.1 `macho' extensions to the `SECTION' Directive 

       The `macho' output format specifies section names in the format
       "_segment_`,'_section_". No spaces are allowed around the comma. The
       following flags can also be specified:

       (*) `data' - this section contains initialized data items

       (*) `code' - this section contains code exclusively

       (*) `mixed' - this section contains both code and data

       (*) `bss' - this section is uninitialized and filled with zero

       (*) `zerofill' - same as `bss'

       (*) `no_dead_strip' - inhibit dead code stripping for this section

       (*) `live_support' - set the live support flag for this section

       (*) `strip_static_syms' - strip static symbols for this section

       (*) `debug' - this section contains debugging information

       (*) `align='_alignment_ - specify section alignment

       The default is `data', unless the section name is `__text' or
       `__bss' in which case the default is `text' or `bss', respectively.

       For compatibility with other Unix platforms, the following standard
       names are also supported:

       .text    = __TEXT,__text  text 
       .rodata  = __DATA,__const data 
       .data    = __DATA,__data  data 
       .bss     = __DATA,__bss   bss

       If the `.rodata' section contains no relocations, it is instead put
       into the `__TEXT,__const' section unless this section has already
       been specified explicitly. However, it is probably better to specify
       `__TEXT,__const' and `__DATA,__const' explicitly as appropriate.

 9.9.2 Thread Local Storage in Mach-O: `macho' special symbols and `WRT'

       Mach-O defines the following special symbols that can be used on the
       right-hand side of the `WRT' operator:

       (*) `..tlvp' is used to specify access to thread-local storage.

       (*) `..gotpcrel' is used to specify references to the Global Offset
           Table. The GOT is supported in the `macho64' format only.

 9.9.3 `macho' specific directive `subsections_via_symbols'

       The directive `subsections_via_symbols' sets the
       `MH_SUBSECTIONS_VIA_SYMBOLS' flag in the Mach-O header, that
       effectively separates a block (or a subsection) based on a symbol.
       It is often used for eliminating dead codes by a linker.

       This directive takes no arguments.

       This is a macro implemented as a `%pragma'. It can also be specified
       in its `%pragma' form, in which case it will not affect non-Mach-O
       builds of the same source code:

            %pragma macho subsections_via_symbols

 9.9.4 `macho' specific directive `no_dead_strip'

       The directive `no_dead_strip' sets the Mach-O `SH_NO_DEAD_STRIP'
       section flag on the section containing a a specific symbol. This
       directive takes a list of symbols as its arguments.

       This is a macro implemented as a `%pragma'. It can also be specified
       in its `%pragma' form, in which case it will not affect non-Mach-O
       builds of the same source code:

            %pragma macho no_dead_strip symbol...

 9.9.5 `macho' specific extensions to the `GLOBAL' Directive: `private_extern'

       The directive extension to `GLOBAL' marks the symbol with limited
       global scope. For example, you can specify the global symbol with
       this extension:

       global foo:private_extern 
       foo: 
                ; codes

       Using with static linker will clear the private extern attribute.
       But linker option like `-keep_private_externs' can avoid it.

 9.9.6 `macho' specific directive `build_version'

       The directive `build_version' generates a `LC_BUILD_VERSION' load
       command in the Mach-O header, which allows specifying a target
       platform, minimum OS version and optionally SDK version. Newer Xcode
       linker versions warn if this is not present in object files.

       This directive takes the target platform name and minimum OS version
       as arguments, in this form:

       build_version macos,10,7

       Platform names that make sense for x86 code are `macos',
       `iossimulator', `tvossimulator' and `watchossimulator'.

       Optionally, a trailing version number and minimum SDK version can
       also be specified with this syntax:

       build_version macos, 10, 14, 0 sdk_version 10, 14, 0

       This is a macro implemented as a `%pragma'. It can also be specified
       in its `%pragma' form, in which case it will not affect non-Mach-O
       builds of the same source code:

            %pragma macho build_version ...

       This latter form is also useful on the command line when using the
       `--pragma' command-line switch:

            nasm -f macho64 --pragma "macho build_version macos,10,9" ...

  9.10 `elf32', `elf64', `elfx32': Executable and Linkable Format Object Files

       The `elf32', `elf64' and `elfx32' output formats generate `ELF32'
       and `ELF64' (Executable and Linkable Format) object files, as used
       by Linux as well as Unix System V, including Solaris x86, UnixWare
       and SCO Unix. ELF provides a default output file-name extension of
       `.o'. `elf' is a synonym for `elf32'.

       The `elfx32' file format is an ELF32 file containing 64-bit x86
       code, and is used for the x32 ABI, which runs the CPU in 64-bit mode
       while using 32-bit values for pointers to reduce memory footprint.
       Thus, code intended to be used with the x32 ABI should be assembled
       with `BITS 64'.

9.10.1 ELF specific directive `osabi'

       The ELF header specifies the application binary interface for the
       target operating system (OSABI). This field can be set by using the
       `osabi' directive with the numeric value (0-255) of the target
       system. If this directive is not used, the default value will be
       "UNIX System V ABI" (0) which will work on most systems which
       support ELF.

9.10.2 ELF extensions to the `SECTION' Directive 

       Like the `obj' format, `elf' allows you to specify additional
       information on the `SECTION' directive line, to control the type and
       properties of sections you declare. Section types and properties are
       generated automatically by NASM for the standard section names, but
       may still be overridden by these qualifiers.

       The available qualifiers are:

       (*) `alloc' defines the section to be one which is loaded into
           memory when the program is run. `noalloc' defines it to be one
           which is not, such as an informational or comment section.

       (*) `exec' defines the section to be one which should have execute
           permission when the program is run. `noexec' defines it as one
           which should not.

       (*) `write' defines the section to be one which should be writable
           when the program is run. `nowrite' defines it as one which
           should not.

       (*) `progbits' defines the section to be one with explicit contents
           stored in the object file: an ordinary code or data section, for
           example.

       (*) `nobits' defines the section to be one with no explicit contents
           given, such as a BSS section.

       (*) `note' indicates that this section contains ELF notes. The
           content of ELF notes are specified using normal assembly
           instructions; it is up to the programmer to ensure these are
           valid ELF notes.

       (*) `preinit_array' indicates that this section contains function
           addresses to be called before any other initialization has
           happened.

       (*) `init_array' indicates that this section contains function
           addresses to be called during initialization.

       (*) `fini_array' indicates that this section contains function
           pointers to be called during termination.

       (*) `align=', used with a trailing number as in `obj', gives the
           alignment requirements of the section.

       (*) `byte', `word', `dword', `qword', `tword', `oword', `yword', or
           `zword' with an optional `*'multiplier specify the fundamental
           data item size for a section which contains either fixed-sized
           data structures or strings; it also sets a default alignment.
           This is generally used with the `strings' and `merge' attributes
           (see below.) For example `byte*4' defines a unit size of 4
           bytes, with a default alignment of 1; `dword' also defines a
           unit size of 4 bytes, but with a default alignment of 4. The
           `align=' attribute, if specified, overrides this default
           alignment.

       (*) `pointer' is equivalent to `dword' for `elf32' or `elfx32', and
           `qword' for `elf64'.

       (*) `strings' indicate that this section contains exclusively null-
           terminated strings. By default these are assumed to be byte
           strings, but a size specifier can be used to override that.

       (*) `merge' indicates that duplicate data elements in this section
           should be merged with data elements from other object files.
           Data elements can be either fixed-sized objects or null-
           terminated strings (with the `strings' attribute). A size
           specifier is required unless `strings' is specified, in which
           case the size defaults to `byte'.

       (*) `tls' defines the section to be one which contains thread local
           variables.

       The defaults assumed by NASM if you do not specify the above
       qualifiers are:


       section .text          progbits      alloc   exec    nowrite  align=16 
       section .rodata        progbits      alloc   noexec  nowrite  align=4 
       section .lrodata       progbits      alloc   noexec  nowrite  align=4 
       section .data          progbits      alloc   noexec  write    align=4 
       section .ldata         progbits      alloc   noexec  write    align=4 
       section .bss           nobits        alloc   noexec  write    align=4 
       section .lbss          nobits        alloc   noexec  write    align=4 
       section .tdata         progbits      alloc   noexec  write    align=4   tls 
       section .tbss          nobits        alloc   noexec  write    align=4   tls 
       section .comment       progbits      noalloc noexec  nowrite  align=1 
       section .preinit_array preinit_array alloc   noexec  nowrite  pointer 
       section .init_array    init_array    alloc   noexec  nowrite  pointer 
       section .fini_array    fini_array    alloc   noexec  nowrite  pointer 
       section .note          note          noalloc noexec  nowrite  align=4 
       section other          progbits      alloc   noexec  nowrite  align=1

       (Any section name other than those in the above table is treated by
       default like `other' in the above table. Please note that section
       names are case sensitive.)

9.10.3 Position-Independent Code: ELF Special Symbols and `WRT'

       Since `ELF' does not support segment-base references, the `WRT'
       operator is not used for its normal purpose; therefore NASM's `elf'
       output format makes use of `WRT' for a different purpose, namely the
       PIC-specific relocation types.

       `elf' defines five special symbols which you can use as the right-
       hand side of the `WRT' operator to obtain PIC relocation types. They
       are `..gotpc', `..gotoff', `..got', `..plt' and `..sym'. Their
       functions are summarized here:

       (*) Referring to the symbol marking the global offset table base
           using `wrt ..gotpc' will end up giving the distance from the
           beginning of the current section to the global offset table.
           (`_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_' is the standard symbol name used to
           refer to the GOT.) So you would then need to add `$$' to the
           result to get the real address of the GOT.

       (*) Referring to a location in one of your own sections using
           `wrt ..gotoff' will give the distance from the beginning of the
           GOT to the specified location, so that adding on the address of
           the GOT would give the real address of the location you wanted.

       (*) Referring to an external or global symbol using `wrt ..got'
           causes the linker to build an entry _in_ the GOT containing the
           address of the symbol, and the reference gives the distance from
           the beginning of the GOT to the entry; so you can add on the
           address of the GOT, load from the resulting address, and end up
           with the address of the symbol.

       (*) Referring to a procedure name using `wrt ..plt' causes the
           linker to build a procedure linkage table entry for the symbol,
           and the reference gives the address of the PLT entry. You can
           only use this in contexts which would generate a PC-relative
           relocation normally (i.e. as the destination for `CALL' or
           `JMP'), since ELF contains no relocation type to refer to PLT
           entries absolutely.

       (*) Referring to a symbol name using `wrt ..sym' causes NASM to
           write an ordinary relocation, but instead of making the
           relocation relative to the start of the section and then adding
           on the offset to the symbol, it will write a relocation record
           aimed directly at the symbol in question. The distinction is a
           necessary one due to a peculiarity of the dynamic linker.

       A fuller explanation of how to use these relocation types to write
       shared libraries entirely in NASM is given in section 11.2.

9.10.4 Thread Local Storage in ELF: `elf' Special Symbols and `WRT'

       (*) In ELF32 mode, referring to an external or global symbol using
           `wrt ..tlsie'  causes the linker to build an entry _in_ the GOT
           containing the offset of the symbol within the TLS block, so you
           can access the value of the symbol with code such as:

              mov  eax,[tid wrt ..tlsie] 
              mov  [gs:eax],ebx

       (*) In ELF64 or ELFx32 mode, referring to an external or global
           symbol using `wrt ..gottpoff'  causes the linker to build an
           entry _in_ the GOT containing the offset of the symbol within
           the TLS block, so you can access the value of the symbol with
           code such as:

              mov   rax,[rel tid wrt ..gottpoff] 
              mov   rcx,[fs:rax]

9.10.5 `elf' Extensions to the `GLOBAL' Directive

       `ELF' object files can contain more information about a global
       symbol than just its address: they can contain the size of the
       symbol and its type as well. These are not merely debugger
       conveniences, but are actually necessary when the program being
       written is a shared library. NASM therefore supports some extensions
       to the `GLOBAL' directive, allowing you to specify these features.

       You can specify whether a global variable is a function or a data
       object by suffixing the name with a colon and the word `function' or
       `data'. (`object' is a synonym for `data'.) For example:

       global   hashlookup:function, hashtable:data

       exports the global symbol `hashlookup' as a function and `hashtable'
       as a data object.

       Optionally, you can control the ELF visibility of the symbol. Just
       add one of the visibility keywords: `default', `internal', `hidden',
       or `protected'. The default is `default' of course. For example, to
       make `hashlookup' hidden:

       global   hashlookup:function hidden

       Since version 2.15, it is possible to specify symbols binding. The
       keywords are: `weak' to generate weak symbol or `strong'. The
       default is `strong'.

       You can also specify the size of the data associated with the
       symbol, as a numeric expression (which may involve labels, and even
       forward references) after the type specifier. Like this:

       global  hashtable:data (hashtable.end - hashtable) 
       
       hashtable: 
               db this,that,theother  ; some data here 
       .end:

       This makes NASM automatically calculate the length of the table and
       place that information into the `ELF' symbol table.

       Declaring the type and size of global symbols is necessary when
       writing shared library code. For more information, see section
       11.2.4.

9.10.6 `elf' Extensions to the `EXTERN' Directive

       Since version 2.15 it is possible to specify keyword `weak' to
       generate weak external reference. Example:

       extern weak_ref:weak

9.10.7 `elf' Extensions to the `COMMON' Directive 

       `ELF' also allows you to specify alignment requirements on common
       variables. This is done by putting a number (which must be a power
       of two) after the name and size of the common variable, separated
       (as usual) by a colon. For example, an array of doublewords would
       benefit from 4-byte alignment:

       common  dwordarray 128:4

       This declares the total size of the array to be 128 bytes, and
       requires that it be aligned on a 4-byte boundary.

9.10.8 16-bit code and ELF 

       Older versions of the `ELF32' specification did not provide
       relocations for 8- and 16-bit values. It is now part of the formal
       specification, and any new enough linker should support them.

       ELF has currently no support for segmented programming.

9.10.9 Debug formats and ELF 

       ELF provides debug information in `STABS' and `DWARF' formats. Line
       number information is generated for all executable sections, but
       please note that only the ".text" section is executable by default.

  9.11 `aout': Linux `a.out' Object Files

       The `aout' format generates `a.out' object files, in the form used
       by early Linux systems (current Linux systems use ELF, see section
       9.10.) These differ from other `a.out' object files in that the
       magic number in the first four bytes of the file is different; also,
       some implementations of `a.out', for example NetBSD's, support
       position-independent code, which Linux's implementation does not.

       `a.out' provides a default output file-name extension of `.o'.

       `a.out' is a very simple object format. It supports no special
       directives, no special symbols, no use of `SEG' or `WRT', and no
       extensions to any standard directives. It supports only the three
       standard section names `.text', `.data' and `.bss'.

  9.12 `aoutb': NetBSD/FreeBSD/OpenBSD `a.out' Object Files

       The `aoutb' format generates `a.out' object files, in the form used
       by the various free `BSD Unix' clones, `NetBSD', `FreeBSD' and
       `OpenBSD'. For simple object files, this object format is exactly
       the same as `aout' except for the magic number in the first four
       bytes of the file. However, the `aoutb' format supports
       position-independent code in the same way as the `elf' format, so
       you can use it to write `BSD' shared libraries.

       `aoutb' provides a default output file-name extension of `.o'.

       `aoutb' supports no special directives, no special symbols, and only
       the three standard section names `.text', `.data' and `.bss'.
       However, it also supports the same use of `WRT' as `elf' does, to
       provide position-independent code relocation types. See section
       9.10.3 for full documentation of this feature.

       `aoutb' also supports the same extensions to the `GLOBAL' directive
       as `elf' does: see section 9.10.5 for documentation of this.

  9.13 `as86': Minix/Linux `as86' Object Files

       The Minix/Linux 16-bit assembler `as86' has its own non-standard
       object file format. Although its companion linker `ld86' produces
       something close to ordinary `a.out' binaries as output, the object
       file format used to communicate between `as86' and `ld86' is not
       itself `a.out'.

       NASM supports this format, just in case it is useful, as `as86'.
       `as86' provides a default output file-name extension of `.o'.

       `as86' is a very simple object format (from the NASM user's point of
       view). It supports no special directives, no use of `SEG' or `WRT',
       and no extensions to any standard directives. It supports only the
       three standard section names `.text', `.data' and `.bss'. The only
       special symbol supported is `..start'.

  9.14 `dbg': Debugging Format

       The `dbg' format does not output an object file as such; instead, it
       outputs a text file which contains a complete list of all the
       transactions between the main body of NASM and the output-format
       back end module. It is primarily intended to aid people who want to
       write their own output drivers, so that they can get a clearer idea
       of the various requests the main program makes of the output driver,
       and in what order they happen.

       For simple files, one can easily use the `dbg' format like this:

       nasm -f dbg filename.asm

       which will generate a diagnostic file called `filename.dbg'.
       However, this will not work well on files which were designed for a
       different object format, because each object format defines its own
       macros (usually user-level forms of directives), and those macros
       will not be defined in the `dbg' format. Therefore it can be useful
       to run NASM twice, in order to do the preprocessing with the native
       object format selected:

       nasm -e -f elf32 -o elfprog.i elfprog.asm 
       nasm -a -f dbg elfprog.i

       This preprocesses `elfprog.asm' into `elfprog.i', keeping the
       `elf32' object format selected in order to make sure ELF special
       directives are converted into primitive form correctly. Then the
       preprocessed source is fed through the `dbg' format to generate the
       final diagnostic output.

       This workaround will still typically not work for programs intended
       for `obj' format, because the `obj' `SEGMENT' and `GROUP' directives
       have side effects of defining the segment and group names as
       symbols; `dbg' will not do this, so the program will not assemble.
       You will have to work around that by defining the symbols yourself
       (using `EXTERN', for example) if you really need to get a `dbg'
       trace of an `obj'-specific source file.

       `dbg' accepts any section name and any directives at all, and logs
       them all to its output file.

       `dbg' accepts and logs any `%pragma', but the specific `%pragma':

            %pragma dbg maxdump <size>

       where `<size>' is either a number or `unlimited', can be used to
       control the maximum size for dumping the full contents of a
       `rawdata' output object.

Chapter 10: Writing 16-bit Code (DOS, Windows 3/3.1)
----------------------------------------------------

       This chapter attempts to cover some of the common issues encountered
       when writing 16-bit code to run under MS-DOS or Windows 3.x. It
       covers how to link programs to produce `.EXE' or `.COM' files, how
       to write `.SYS' device drivers, and how to interface assembly
       language code with 16-bit C compilers and with Borland Pascal.

  10.1 Producing `.EXE' Files

       Any large program written under DOS needs to be built as a `.EXE'
       file: only `.EXE' files have the necessary internal structure
       required to span more than one 64K segment. Windows programs, also,
       have to be built as `.EXE' files, since Windows does not support the
       `.COM' format.

       In general, you generate `.EXE' files by using the `obj' output
       format to produce one or more `.obj' files, and then linking them
       together using a linker. However, NASM also supports the direct
       generation of simple DOS `.EXE' files using the `bin' output format
       (by using `DB' and `DW' to construct the `.EXE' file header), and a
       macro package is supplied to do this. Thanks to Yann Guidon for
       contributing the code for this.

       NASM may also support `.EXE' natively as another output format in
       future releases.

10.1.1 Using the `obj' Format To Generate `.EXE' Files

       This section describes the usual method of generating `.EXE' files
       by linking `.OBJ' files together.

       Most 16-bit programming language packages come with a suitable
       linker; if you have none of these, there is a free linker called
       VAL, available in `LZH' archive format from `x2ftp.oulu.fi'. An LZH
       archiver can be found at `ftp.simtel.net'. There is another `free'
       linker (though this one doesn't come with sources) called FREELINK,
       available from `www.pcorner.com'. A third, `djlink', written by DJ
       Delorie, is available at `www.delorie.com'. A fourth linker,
       `ALINK', written by Anthony A.J. Williams, is available at
       `alink.sourceforge.net'.

       When linking several `.OBJ' files into a `.EXE' file, you should
       ensure that exactly one of them has a start point defined (using the
       `..start' special symbol defined by the `obj' format: see section
       9.4.6). If no module defines a start point, the linker will not know
       what value to give the entry-point field in the output file header;
       if more than one defines a start point, the linker will not know
       _which_ value to use.

       An example of a NASM source file which can be assembled to a `.OBJ'
       file and linked on its own to a `.EXE' is given here. It
       demonstrates the basic principles of defining a stack, initialising
       the segment registers, and declaring a start point. This file is
       also provided in the `test' subdirectory of the NASM archives, under
       the name `objexe.asm'.

       segment code 
       
       ..start: 
               mov     ax,data 
               mov     ds,ax 
               mov     ax,stack 
               mov     ss,ax 
               mov     sp,stacktop

       This initial piece of code sets up `DS' to point to the data
       segment, and initializes `SS' and `SP' to point to the top of the
       provided stack. Notice that interrupts are implicitly disabled for
       one instruction after a move into `SS', precisely for this
       situation, so that there's no chance of an interrupt occurring
       between the loads of `SS' and `SP' and not having a stack to execute
       on.

       Note also that the special symbol `..start' is defined at the
       beginning of this code, which means that will be the entry point
       into the resulting executable file.

               mov     dx,hello 
               mov     ah,9 
               int     0x21

       The above is the main program: load `DS:DX' with a pointer to the
       greeting message (`hello' is implicitly relative to the segment
       `data', which was loaded into `DS' in the setup code, so the full
       pointer is valid), and call the DOS print-string function.

               mov     ax,0x4c00 
               int     0x21

       This terminates the program using another DOS system call.

       segment data 
       
       hello:  db      'hello, world', 13, 10, '$'

       The data segment contains the string we want to display.

       segment stack stack 
               resb 64 
       stacktop:

       The above code declares a stack segment containing 64 bytes of
       uninitialized stack space, and points `stacktop' at the top of it.
       The directive `segment stack stack' defines a segment _called_
       `stack', and also of _type_ `STACK'. The latter is not necessary to
       the correct running of the program, but linkers are likely to issue
       warnings or errors if your program has no segment of type `STACK'.

       The above file, when assembled into a `.OBJ' file, will link on its
       own to a valid `.EXE' file, which when run will print `hello, world'
       and then exit.

10.1.2 Using the `bin' Format To Generate `.EXE' Files

       The `.EXE' file format is simple enough that it's possible to build
       a `.EXE' file by writing a pure-binary program and sticking a 32-
       byte header on the front. This header is simple enough that it can
       be generated using `DB' and `DW' commands by NASM itself, so that
       you can use the `bin' output format to directly generate `.EXE'
       files.

       Included in the NASM archives, in the `misc' subdirectory, is a file
       `exebin.mac' of macros. It defines three macros: `EXE_begin',
       `EXE_stack' and `EXE_end'.

       To produce a `.EXE' file using this method, you should start by
       using `%include' to load the `exebin.mac' macro package into your
       source file. You should then issue the `EXE_begin' macro call (which
       takes no arguments) to generate the file header data. Then write
       code as normal for the `bin' format - you can use all three standard
       sections `.text', `.data' and `.bss'. At the end of the file you
       should call the `EXE_end' macro (again, no arguments), which defines
       some symbols to mark section sizes, and these symbols are referred
       to in the header code generated by `EXE_begin'.

       In this model, the code you end up writing starts at `0x100', just
       like a `.COM' file - in fact, if you strip off the 32-byte header
       from the resulting `.EXE' file, you will have a valid `.COM'
       program. All the segment bases are the same, so you are limited to a
       64K program, again just like a `.COM' file. Note that an `ORG'
       directive is issued by the `EXE_begin' macro, so you should not
       explicitly issue one of your own.

       You can't directly refer to your segment base value, unfortunately,
       since this would require a relocation in the header, and things
       would get a lot more complicated. So you should get your segment
       base by copying it out of `CS' instead.

       On entry to your `.EXE' file, `SS:SP' are already set up to point to
       the top of a 2Kb stack. You can adjust the default stack size of 2Kb
       by calling the `EXE_stack' macro. For example, to change the stack
       size of your program to 64 bytes, you would call `EXE_stack 64'.

       A sample program which generates a `.EXE' file in this way is given
       in the `test' subdirectory of the NASM archive, as `binexe.asm'.

  10.2 Producing `.COM' Files

       While large DOS programs must be written as `.EXE' files, small ones
       are often better written as `.COM' files. `.COM' files are pure
       binary, and therefore most easily produced using the `bin' output
       format.

10.2.1 Using the `bin' Format To Generate `.COM' Files

       `.COM' files expect to be loaded at offset `100h' into their segment
       (though the segment may change). Execution then begins at `100h',
       i.e. right at the start of the program. So to write a `.COM'
       program, you would create a source file looking like

               org 100h 
       
       section .text 
       
       start: 
               ; put your code here 
       
       section .data 
       
               ; put data items here 
       
       section .bss 
       
               ; put uninitialized data here

       The `bin' format puts the `.text' section first in the file, so you
       can declare data or BSS items before beginning to write code if you
       want to and the code will still end up at the front of the file
       where it belongs.

       The BSS (uninitialized data) section does not take up space in the
       `.COM' file itself: instead, addresses of BSS items are resolved to
       point at space beyond the end of the file, on the grounds that this
       will be free memory when the program is run. Therefore you should
       not rely on your BSS being initialized to all zeros when you run.

       To assemble the above program, you should use a command line like

       nasm myprog.asm -fbin -o myprog.com

       The `bin' format would produce a file called `myprog' if no explicit
       output file name were specified, so you have to override it and give
       the desired file name.

10.2.2 Using the `obj' Format To Generate `.COM' Files

       If you are writing a `.COM' program as more than one module, you may
       wish to assemble several `.OBJ' files and link them together into a
       `.COM' program. You can do this, provided you have a linker capable
       of outputting `.COM' files directly (TLINK does this), or
       alternatively a converter program such as `EXE2BIN' to transform the
       `.EXE' file output from the linker into a `.COM' file.

       If you do this, you need to take care of several things:

       (*) The first object file containing code should start its code
           segment with a line like `RESB 100h'. This is to ensure that the
           code begins at offset `100h' relative to the beginning of the
           code segment, so that the linker or converter program does not
           have to adjust address references within the file when
           generating the `.COM' file. Other assemblers use an `ORG'
           directive for this purpose, but `ORG' in NASM is a format-
           specific directive to the `bin' output format, and does not mean
           the same thing as it does in MASM-compatible assemblers.

       (*) You don't need to define a stack segment.

       (*) All your segments should be in the same group, so that every
           time your code or data references a symbol offset, all offsets
           are relative to the same segment base. This is because, when a
           `.COM' file is loaded, all the segment registers contain the
           same value.

  10.3 Producing `.SYS' Files

       MS-DOS device drivers - `.SYS' files - are pure binary files,
       similar to `.COM' files, except that they start at origin zero
       rather than `100h'. Therefore, if you are writing a device driver
       using the `bin' format, you do not need the `ORG' directive, since
       the default origin for `bin' is zero. Similarly, if you are using
       `obj', you do not need the `RESB 100h' at the start of your code
       segment.

       `.SYS' files start with a header structure, containing pointers to
       the various routines inside the driver which do the work. This
       structure should be defined at the start of the code segment, even
       though it is not actually code.

       For more information on the format of `.SYS' files, and the data
       which has to go in the header structure, a list of books is given in
       the Frequently Asked Questions list for the newsgroup
       `comp.os.msdos.programmer'.

  10.4 Interfacing to 16-bit C Programs

       This section covers the basics of writing assembly routines that
       call, or are called from, C programs. To do this, you would
       typically write an assembly module as a `.OBJ' file, and link it
       with your C modules to produce a mixed-language program.

10.4.1 External Symbol Names

       C compilers have the convention that the names of all global symbols
       (functions or data) they define are formed by prefixing an
       underscore to the name as it appears in the C program. So, for
       example, the function a C programmer thinks of as `printf' appears
       to an assembly language programmer as `_printf'. This means that in
       your assembly programs, you can define symbols without a leading
       underscore, and not have to worry about name clashes with C symbols.

       If you find the underscores inconvenient, you can define macros to
       replace the `GLOBAL' and `EXTERN' directives as follows:

       %macro  cglobal 1 
       
         global  _%1 
         %define %1 _%1 
       
       %endmacro 
       
       %macro  cextern 1 
       
         extern  _%1 
         %define %1 _%1 
       
       %endmacro

       (These forms of the macros only take one argument at a time; a
       `%rep' construct could solve this.)

       If you then declare an external like this:

       cextern printf

       then the macro will expand it as

       extern  _printf 
       %define printf _printf

       Thereafter, you can reference `printf' as if it was a symbol, and
       the preprocessor will put the leading underscore on where necessary.

       The `cglobal' macro works similarly. You must use `cglobal' before
       defining the symbol in question, but you would have had to do that
       anyway if you used `GLOBAL'.

       Also see section 2.1.28.

10.4.2 Memory Models

       NASM contains no mechanism to support the various C memory models
       directly; you have to keep track yourself of which one you are
       writing for. This means you have to keep track of the following
       things:

       (*) In models using a single code segment (tiny, small and compact),
           functions are near. This means that function pointers, when
           stored in data segments or pushed on the stack as function
           arguments, are 16 bits long and contain only an offset field
           (the `CS' register never changes its value, and always gives the
           segment part of the full function address), and that functions
           are called using ordinary near `CALL' instructions and return
           using `RETN' (which, in NASM, is synonymous with `RET' anyway).
           This means both that you should write your own routines to
           return with `RETN', and that you should call external C routines
           with near `CALL' instructions.

       (*) In models using more than one code segment (medium, large and
           huge), functions are far. This means that function pointers are
           32 bits long (consisting of a 16-bit offset followed by a 16-bit
           segment), and that functions are called using `CALL FAR' (or
           `CALL seg:offset') and return using `RETF'. Again, you should
           therefore write your own routines to return with `RETF' and use
           `CALL FAR' to call external routines.

       (*) In models using a single data segment (tiny, small and medium),
           data pointers are 16 bits long, containing only an offset field
           (the `DS' register doesn't change its value, and always gives
           the segment part of the full data item address).

       (*) In models using more than one data segment (compact, large and
           huge), data pointers are 32 bits long, consisting of a 16-bit
           offset followed by a 16-bit segment. You should still be careful
           not to modify `DS' in your routines without restoring it
           afterwards, but `ES' is free for you to use to access the
           contents of 32-bit data pointers you are passed.

       (*) The huge memory model allows single data items to exceed 64K in
           size. In all other memory models, you can access the whole of a
           data item just by doing arithmetic on the offset field of the
           pointer you are given, whether a segment field is present or
           not; in huge model, you have to be more careful of your pointer
           arithmetic.

       (*) In most memory models, there is a _default_ data segment, whose
           segment address is kept in `DS' throughout the program. This
           data segment is typically the same segment as the stack, kept in
           `SS', so that functions' local variables (which are stored on
           the stack) and global data items can both be accessed easily
           without changing `DS'. Particularly large data items are
           typically stored in other segments. However, some memory models
           (though not the standard ones, usually) allow the assumption
           that `SS' and `DS' hold the same value to be removed. Be careful
           about functions' local variables in this latter case.

       In models with a single code segment, the segment is called `_TEXT',
       so your code segment must also go by this name in order to be linked
       into the same place as the main code segment. In models with a
       single data segment, or with a default data segment, it is called
       `_DATA'.

10.4.3 Function Definitions and Function Calls

       The C calling convention in 16-bit programs is as follows. In the
       following description, the words _caller_ and _callee_ are used to
       denote the function doing the calling and the function which gets
       called.

       (*) The caller pushes the function's parameters on the stack, one
           after another, in reverse order (right to left, so that the
           first argument specified to the function is pushed last).

       (*) The caller then executes a `CALL' instruction to pass control to
           the callee. This `CALL' is either near or far depending on the
           memory model.

       (*) The callee receives control, and typically (although this is not
           actually necessary, in functions which do not need to access
           their parameters) starts by saving the value of `SP' in `BP' so
           as to be able to use `BP' as a base pointer to find its
           parameters on the stack. However, the caller was probably doing
           this too, so part of the calling convention states that `BP'
           must be preserved by any C function. Hence the callee, if it is
           going to set up `BP' as a _frame pointer_, must push the
           previous value first.

       (*) The callee may then access its parameters relative to `BP'. The
           word at `[BP]' holds the previous value of `BP' as it was
           pushed; the next word, at `[BP+2]', holds the offset part of the
           return address, pushed implicitly by `CALL'. In a small-model
           (near) function, the parameters start after that, at `[BP+4]';
           in a large-model (far) function, the segment part of the return
           address lives at `[BP+4]', and the parameters begin at `[BP+6]'.
           The leftmost parameter of the function, since it was pushed
           last, is accessible at this offset from `BP'; the others follow,
           at successively greater offsets. Thus, in a function such as
           `printf' which takes a variable number of parameters, the
           pushing of the parameters in reverse order means that the
           function knows where to find its first parameter, which tells it
           the number and type of the remaining ones.

       (*) The callee may also wish to decrease `SP' further, so as to
           allocate space on the stack for local variables, which will then
           be accessible at negative offsets from `BP'.

       (*) The callee, if it wishes to return a value to the caller, should
           leave the value in `AL', `AX' or `DX:AX' depending on the size
           of the value. Floating-point results are sometimes (depending on
           the compiler) returned in `ST0'.

       (*) Once the callee has finished processing, it restores `SP' from
           `BP' if it had allocated local stack space, then pops the
           previous value of `BP', and returns via `RETN' or `RETF'
           depending on memory model.

       (*) When the caller regains control from the callee, the function
           parameters are still on the stack, so it typically adds an
           immediate constant to `SP' to remove them (instead of executing
           a number of slow `POP' instructions). Thus, if a function is
           accidentally called with the wrong number of parameters due to a
           prototype mismatch, the stack will still be returned to a
           sensible state since the caller, which _knows_ how many
           parameters it pushed, does the removing.

       It is instructive to compare this calling convention with that for
       Pascal programs (described in section 10.5.1). Pascal has a simpler
       convention, since no functions have variable numbers of parameters.
       Therefore the callee knows how many parameters it should have been
       passed, and is able to deallocate them from the stack itself by
       passing an immediate argument to the `RET' or `RETF' instruction, so
       the caller does not have to do it. Also, the parameters are pushed
       in left-to-right order, not right-to-left, which means that a
       compiler can give better guarantees about sequence points without
       performance suffering.

       Thus, you would define a function in C style in the following way.
       The following example is for small model:

       global  _myfunc 
       
       _myfunc: 
               push    bp 
               mov     bp,sp 
               sub     sp,0x40         ; 64 bytes of local stack space 
               mov     bx,[bp+4]       ; first parameter to function 
       
               ; some more code 
       
               mov     sp,bp           ; undo "sub sp,0x40" above 
               pop     bp 
               ret

       For a large-model function, you would replace `RET' by `RETF', and
       look for the first parameter at `[BP+6]' instead of `[BP+4]'. Of
       course, if one of the parameters is a pointer, then the offsets of
       _subsequent_ parameters will change depending on the memory model as
       well: far pointers take up four bytes on the stack when passed as a
       parameter, whereas near pointers take up two.

       At the other end of the process, to call a C function from your
       assembly code, you would do something like this:

       extern  _printf 
       
             ; and then, further down... 
       
             push    word [myint]        ; one of my integer variables 
             push    word mystring       ; pointer into my data segment 
             call    _printf 
             add     sp,byte 4           ; `byte' saves space 
       
             ; then those data items... 
       
       segment _DATA 
       
       myint         dw    1234 
       mystring      db    'This number -> %d <- should be 1234',10,0

       This piece of code is the small-model assembly equivalent of the C
       code

           int myint = 1234; 
           printf("This number -> %d <- should be 1234\n", myint);

       In large model, the function-call code might look more like this. In
       this example, it is assumed that `DS' already holds the segment base
       of the segment `_DATA'. If not, you would have to initialize it
       first.

             push    word [myint] 
             push    word seg mystring   ; Now push the segment, and... 
             push    word mystring       ; ... offset of "mystring" 
             call    far _printf 
             add    sp,byte 6

       The integer value still takes up one word on the stack, since large
       model does not affect the size of the `int' data type. The first
       argument (pushed last) to `printf', however, is a data pointer, and
       therefore has to contain a segment and offset part. The segment
       should be stored second in memory, and therefore must be pushed
       first. (Of course, `PUSH DS' would have been a shorter instruction
       than `PUSH WORD SEG mystring', if `DS' was set up as the above
       example assumed.) Then the actual call becomes a far call, since
       functions expect far calls in large model; and `SP' has to be
       increased by 6 rather than 4 afterwards to make up for the extra
       word of parameters.

10.4.4 Accessing Data Items

       To get at the contents of C variables, or to declare variables which
       C can access, you need only declare the names as `GLOBAL' or
       `EXTERN'. (Again, the names require leading underscores, as stated
       in section 10.4.1.) Thus, a C variable declared as `int i' can be
       accessed from assembler as

       extern _i 
       
               mov ax,[_i]

       And to declare your own integer variable which C programs can access
       as `extern int j', you do this (making sure you are assembling in
       the `_DATA' segment, if necessary):

       global  _j 
       
       _j      dw      0

       To access a C array, you need to know the size of the components of
       the array. For example, `int' variables are two bytes long, so if a
       C program declares an array as `int a[10]', you can access `a[3]' by
       coding `mov ax,[_a+6]'. (The byte offset 6 is obtained by
       multiplying the desired array index, 3, by the size of the array
       element, 2.) The sizes of the C base types in 16-bit compilers are:
       1 for `char', 2 for `short' and `int', 4 for `long' and `float', and
       8 for `double'.

       To access a C data structure, you need to know the offset from the
       base of the structure to the field you are interested in. You can
       either do this by converting the C structure definition into a NASM
       structure definition (using `STRUC'), or by calculating the one
       offset and using just that.

       To do either of these, you should read your C compiler's manual to
       find out how it organizes data structures. NASM gives no special
       alignment to structure members in its own `STRUC' macro, so you have
       to specify alignment yourself if the C compiler generates it.
       Typically, you might find that a structure like

       struct { 
           char c; 
           int i; 
       } foo;

       might be four bytes long rather than three, since the `int' field
       would be aligned to a two-byte boundary. However, this sort of
       feature tends to be a configurable option in the C compiler, either
       using command-line options or `#pragma' lines, so you have to find
       out how your own compiler does it.

10.4.5 `c16.mac': Helper Macros for the 16-bit C Interface

       Included in the NASM archives, in the `misc' directory, is a file
       `c16.mac' of macros. It defines three macros: `proc', `arg' and
       `endproc'. These are intended to be used for C-style procedure
       definitions, and they automate a lot of the work involved in keeping
       track of the calling convention.

       (An alternative, TASM compatible form of `arg' is also now built
       into NASM's preprocessor. See section 5.10 for details.)

       An example of an assembly function using the macro set is given
       here:

       proc    _nearproc 
       
       %$i     arg 
       %$j     arg 
               mov     ax,[bp + %$i] 
               mov     bx,[bp + %$j] 
               add     ax,[bx] 
       
       endproc

       This defines `_nearproc' to be a procedure taking two arguments, the
       first (`i') an integer and the second (`j') a pointer to an integer.
       It returns `i + *j'.

       Note that the `arg' macro has an `EQU' as the first line of its
       expansion, and since the label before the macro call gets prepended
       to the first line of the expanded macro, the `EQU' works, defining
       `%$i' to be an offset from `BP'. A context-local variable is used,
       local to the context pushed by the `proc' macro and popped by the
       `endproc' macro, so that the same argument name can be used in later
       procedures. Of course, you don't _have_ to do that.

       The macro set produces code for near functions (tiny, small and
       compact-model code) by default. You can have it generate far
       functions (medium, large and huge-model code) by means of coding
       `%define FARCODE'. This changes the kind of return instruction
       generated by `endproc', and also changes the starting point for the
       argument offsets. The macro set contains no intrinsic dependency on
       whether data pointers are far or not.

       `arg' can take an optional parameter, giving the size of the
       argument. If no size is given, 2 is assumed, since it is likely that
       many function parameters will be of type `int'.

       The large-model equivalent of the above function would look like
       this:

       %define FARCODE 
       
       proc    _farproc 
       
       %$i     arg 
       %$j     arg     4 
               mov     ax,[bp + %$i] 
               mov     bx,[bp + %$j] 
               mov     es,[bp + %$j + 2] 
               add     ax,[bx] 
       
       endproc

       This makes use of the argument to the `arg' macro to define a
       parameter of size 4, because `j' is now a far pointer. When we load
       from `j', we must load a segment and an offset.

  10.5 Interfacing to Borland Pascal Programs

       Interfacing to Borland Pascal programs is similar in concept to
       interfacing to 16-bit C programs. The differences are:

       (*) The leading underscore required for interfacing to C programs is
           not required for Pascal.

       (*) The memory model is always large: functions are far, data
           pointers are far, and no data item can be more than 64K long.
           (Actually, some functions are near, but only those functions
           that are local to a Pascal unit and never called from outside
           it. All assembly functions that Pascal calls, and all Pascal
           functions that assembly routines are able to call, are far.)
           However, all static data declared in a Pascal program goes into
           the default data segment, which is the one whose segment address
           will be in `DS' when control is passed to your assembly code.
           The only things that do not live in the default data segment are
           local variables (they live in the stack segment) and dynamically
           allocated variables. All data _pointers_, however, are far.

       (*) The function calling convention is different - described below.

       (*) Some data types, such as strings, are stored differently.

       (*) There are restrictions on the segment names you are allowed to
           use - Borland Pascal will ignore code or data declared in a
           segment it doesn't like the name of. The restrictions are
           described below.

10.5.1 The Pascal Calling Convention

       The 16-bit Pascal calling convention is as follows. In the following
       description, the words _caller_ and _callee_ are used to denote the
       function doing the calling and the function which gets called.

       (*) The caller pushes the function's parameters on the stack, one
           after another, in normal order (left to right, so that the first
           argument specified to the function is pushed first).

       (*) The caller then executes a far `CALL' instruction to pass
           control to the callee.

       (*) The callee receives control, and typically (although this is not
           actually necessary, in functions which do not need to access
           their parameters) starts by saving the value of `SP' in `BP' so
           as to be able to use `BP' as a base pointer to find its
           parameters on the stack. However, the caller was probably doing
           this too, so part of the calling convention states that `BP'
           must be preserved by any function. Hence the callee, if it is
           going to set up `BP' as a frame pointer, must push the previous
           value first.

       (*) The callee may then access its parameters relative to `BP'. The
           word at `[BP]' holds the previous value of `BP' as it was
           pushed. The next word, at `[BP+2]', holds the offset part of the
           return address, and the next one at `[BP+4]' the segment part.
           The parameters begin at `[BP+6]'. The rightmost parameter of the
           function, since it was pushed last, is accessible at this offset
           from `BP'; the others follow, at successively greater offsets.

       (*) The callee may also wish to decrease `SP' further, so as to
           allocate space on the stack for local variables, which will then
           be accessible at negative offsets from `BP'.

       (*) The callee, if it wishes to return a value to the caller, should
           leave the value in `AL', `AX' or `DX:AX' depending on the size
           of the value. Floating-point results are returned in `ST0'.
           Results of type `Real' (Borland's own custom floating-point data
           type, not handled directly by the FPU) are returned in
           `DX:BX:AX'. To return a result of type `String', the caller
           pushes a pointer to a temporary string before pushing the
           parameters, and the callee places the returned string value at
           that location. The pointer is not a parameter, and should not be
           removed from the stack by the `RETF' instruction.

       (*) Once the callee has finished processing, it restores `SP' from
           `BP' if it had allocated local stack space, then pops the
           previous value of `BP', and returns via `RETF'. It uses the form
           of `RETF' with an immediate parameter, giving the number of
           bytes taken up by the parameters on the stack. This causes the
           parameters to be removed from the stack as a side effect of the
           return instruction.

       (*) When the caller regains control from the callee, the function
           parameters have already been removed from the stack, so it needs
           to do nothing further.

       Thus, you would define a function in Pascal style, taking two
       `Integer'-type parameters, in the following way:

       global  myfunc 
       
       myfunc: push    bp 
               mov     bp,sp 
               sub     sp,0x40         ; 64 bytes of local stack space 
               mov     bx,[bp+8]       ; first parameter to function 
               mov     bx,[bp+6]       ; second parameter to function 
       
               ; some more code 
       
               mov     sp,bp           ; undo "sub sp,0x40" above 
               pop     bp 
               retf    4               ; total size of params is 4

       At the other end of the process, to call a Pascal function from your
       assembly code, you would do something like this:

       extern  SomeFunc 
       
              ; and then, further down... 
       
              push   word seg mystring   ; Now push the segment, and... 
              push   word mystring       ; ... offset of "mystring" 
              push   word [myint]        ; one of my variables 
              call   far SomeFunc

       This is equivalent to the Pascal code

       procedure SomeFunc(String: PChar; Int: Integer); 
           SomeFunc(@mystring, myint);

10.5.2 Borland Pascal Segment Name Restrictions

       Since Borland Pascal's internal unit file format is completely
       different from `OBJ', it only makes a very sketchy job of actually
       reading and understanding the various information contained in a
       real `OBJ' file when it links that in. Therefore an object file
       intended to be linked to a Pascal program must obey a number of
       restrictions:

       (*) Procedures and functions must be in a segment whose name is
           either `CODE', `CSEG', or something ending in `_TEXT'.

       (*) initialized data must be in a segment whose name is either
           `CONST' or something ending in `_DATA'.

       (*) Uninitialized data must be in a segment whose name is either
           `DATA', `DSEG', or something ending in `_BSS'.

       (*) Any other segments in the object file are completely ignored.
           `GROUP' directives and segment attributes are also ignored.

10.5.3 Using `c16.mac' With Pascal Programs

       The `c16.mac' macro package, described in section 10.4.5, can also
       be used to simplify writing functions to be called from Pascal
       programs, if you code `%define PASCAL'. This definition ensures that
       functions are far (it implies `FARCODE'), and also causes procedure
       return instructions to be generated with an operand.

       Defining `PASCAL' does not change the code which calculates the
       argument offsets; you must declare your function's arguments in
       reverse order. For example:

       %define PASCAL 
       
       proc    _pascalproc 
       
       %$j     arg 4 
       %$i     arg 
               mov     ax,[bp + %$i] 
               mov     bx,[bp + %$j] 
               mov     es,[bp + %$j + 2] 
               add     ax,[bx] 
       
       endproc

       This defines the same routine, conceptually, as the example in
       section 10.4.5: it defines a function taking two arguments, an
       integer and a pointer to an integer, which returns the sum of the
       integer and the contents of the pointer. The only difference between
       this code and the large-model C version is that `PASCAL' is defined
       instead of `FARCODE', and that the arguments are declared in reverse
       order.

       This chapter attempts to cover some of the common issues involved
       when writing 32-bit code, to run under Win32 or Unix, or to be
       linked with C code generated by a Unix-style C compiler such as
       DJGPP. It covers how to write assembly code to interface with 32-bit
       C routines, and how to write position-independent code for shared
       libraries.

       Almost all 32-bit code, and in particular all code running under
       `Win32', `DJGPP' or any of the PC Unix variants, runs in _flat_
       memory model. This means that the segment registers and paging have
       already been set up to give you the same 32-bit 4Gb address space no
       matter what segment you work relative to, and that you should ignore
       all segment registers completely. When writing flat-model
       application code, you never need to use a segment override or modify
       any segment register, and the code-section addresses you pass to
       `CALL' and `JMP' live in the same address space as the data-section
       addresses you access your variables by and the stack-section
       addresses you access local variables and procedure parameters by.
       Every address is 32 bits long and contains only an offset part.

  11.1 Interfacing to 32-bit C Programs

       A lot of the discussion in section 10.4, about interfacing to 16-bit
       C programs, still applies when working in 32 bits. The absence of
       memory models or segmentation worries simplifies things a lot.

11.1.1 External Symbol Names

       Most 32-bit C compilers share the convention used by 16-bit
       compilers, that the names of all global symbols (functions or data)
       they define are formed by prefixing an underscore to the name as it
       appears in the C program. However, not all of them do: the `ELF'
       specification states that C symbols do _not_ have a leading
       underscore on their assembly-language names.

       The older Linux `a.out' C compiler, all `Win32' compilers, `DJGPP',
       and `NetBSD' and `FreeBSD', all use the leading underscore; for
       these compilers, the macros `cextern' and `cglobal', as given in
       section 10.4.1, will still work. For `ELF', though, the leading
       underscore should not be used.

       See also section 2.1.28.

11.1.2 Function Definitions and Function Calls

       The C calling convention in 32-bit programs is as follows. In the
       following description, the words _caller_ and _callee_ are used to
       denote the function doing the calling and the function which gets
       called.

       (*) The caller pushes the function's parameters on the stack, one
           after another, in reverse order (right to left, so that the
           first argument specified to the function is pushed last).

       (*) The caller then executes a near `CALL' instruction to pass
           control to the callee.

       (*) The callee receives control, and typically (although this is not
           actually necessary, in functions which do not need to access
           their parameters) starts by saving the value of `ESP' in `EBP'
           so as to be able to use `EBP' as a base pointer to find its
           parameters on the stack. However, the caller was probably doing
           this too, so part of the calling convention states that `EBP'
           must be preserved by any C function. Hence the callee, if it is
           going to set up `EBP' as a frame pointer, must push the previous
           value first.

       (*) The callee may then access its parameters relative to `EBP'. The
           doubleword at `[EBP]' holds the previous value of `EBP' as it
           was pushed; the next doubleword, at `[EBP+4]', holds the return
           address, pushed implicitly by `CALL'. The parameters start after
           that, at `[EBP+8]'. The leftmost parameter of the function,
           since it was pushed last, is accessible at this offset from
           `EBP'; the others follow, at successively greater offsets. Thus,
           in a function such as `printf' which takes a variable number of
           parameters, the pushing of the parameters in reverse order means
           that the function knows where to find its first parameter, which
           tells it the number and type of the remaining ones.

       (*) The callee may also wish to decrease `ESP' further, so as to
           allocate space on the stack for local variables, which will then
           be accessible at negative offsets from `EBP'.

       (*) The callee, if it wishes to return a value to the caller, should
           leave the value in `AL', `AX' or `EAX' depending on the size of
           the value. Floating-point results are typically returned in
           `ST0'.

       (*) Once the callee has finished processing, it restores `ESP' from
           `EBP' if it had allocated local stack space, then pops the
           previous value of `EBP', and returns via `RET' (equivalently,
           `RETN').

       (*) When the caller regains control from the callee, the function
           parameters are still on the stack, so it typically adds an
           immediate constant to `ESP' to remove them (instead of executing
           a number of slow `POP' instructions). Thus, if a function is
           accidentally called with the wrong number of parameters due to a
           prototype mismatch, the stack will still be returned to a
           sensible state since the caller, which _knows_ how many
           parameters it pushed, does the removing.

       There is an alternative calling convention used by Win32 programs
       for Windows API calls, and also for functions called _by_ the
       Windows API such as window procedures: they follow what Microsoft
       calls the `__stdcall' convention. This is slightly closer to the
       Pascal convention, in that the callee clears the stack by passing a
       parameter to the `RET' instruction. However, the parameters are
       still pushed in right-to-left order.

       Thus, you would define a function in C style in the following way:

       global  _myfunc 
       
       _myfunc: 
               push    ebp 
               mov     ebp,esp 
               sub     esp,0x40        ; 64 bytes of local stack space 
               mov     ebx,[ebp+8]     ; first parameter to function 
       
               ; some more code 
       
               leave                   ; mov esp,ebp / pop ebp 
               ret

       At the other end of the process, to call a C function from your
       assembly code, you would do something like this:

       extern  _printf 
       
               ; and then, further down... 
       
               push    dword [myint]   ; one of my integer variables 
               push    dword mystring  ; pointer into my data segment 
               call    _printf 
               add     esp,byte 8      ; `byte' saves space 
       
               ; then those data items... 
       
       segment _DATA 
       
       myint       dd   1234 
       mystring    db   'This number -> %d <- should be 1234',10,0

       This piece of code is the assembly equivalent of the C code

           int myint = 1234; 
           printf("This number -> %d <- should be 1234\n", myint);

11.1.3 Accessing Data Items

       To get at the contents of C variables, or to declare variables which
       C can access, you need only declare the names as `GLOBAL' or
       `EXTERN'. (Again, the names require leading underscores, as stated
       in section 11.1.1.) Thus, a C variable declared as `int i' can be
       accessed from assembler as

                 extern _i 
                 mov eax,[_i]

       And to declare your own integer variable which C programs can access
       as `extern int j', you do this (making sure you are assembling in
       the `_DATA' segment, if necessary):

                 global _j 
       _j        dd 0

       To access a C array, you need to know the size of the components of
       the array. For example, `int' variables are four bytes long, so if a
       C program declares an array as `int a[10]', you can access `a[3]' by
       coding `mov ax,[_a+12]'. (The byte offset 12 is obtained by
       multiplying the desired array index, 3, by the size of the array
       element, 4.) The sizes of the C base types in 32-bit compilers are:
       1 for `char', 2 for `short', 4 for `int', `long' and `float', and 8
       for `double'. Pointers, being 32-bit addresses, are also 4 bytes
       long.

       To access a C data structure, you need to know the offset from the
       base of the structure to the field you are interested in. You can
       either do this by converting the C structure definition into a NASM
       structure definition (using `STRUC'), or by calculating the one
       offset and using just that.

       To do either of these, you should read your C compiler's manual to
       find out how it organizes data structures. NASM gives no special
       alignment to structure members in its own `STRUC' macro, so you have
       to specify alignment yourself if the C compiler generates it.
       Typically, you might find that a structure like

       struct { 
           char c; 
           int i; 
       } foo;

       might be eight bytes long rather than five, since the `int' field
       would be aligned to a four-byte boundary. However, this sort of
       feature is sometimes a configurable option in the C compiler, either
       using command-line options or `#pragma' lines, so you have to find
       out how your own compiler does it.

11.1.4 `c32.mac': Helper Macros for the 32-bit C Interface

       Included in the NASM archives, in the `misc' directory, is a file
       `c32.mac' of macros. It defines three macros: `proc', `arg' and
       `endproc'. These are intended to be used for C-style procedure
       definitions, and they automate a lot of the work involved in keeping
       track of the calling convention.

       An example of an assembly function using the macro set is given
       here:

       proc    _proc32 
       
       %$i     arg 
       %$j     arg 
               mov     eax,[ebp + %$i] 
               mov     ebx,[ebp + %$j] 
               add     eax,[ebx] 
       
       endproc

       This defines `_proc32' to be a procedure taking two arguments, the
       first (`i') an integer and the second (`j') a pointer to an integer.
       It returns `i + *j'.

       Note that the `arg' macro has an `EQU' as the first line of its
       expansion, and since the label before the macro call gets prepended
       to the first line of the expanded macro, the `EQU' works, defining
       `%$i' to be an offset from `BP'. A context-local variable is used,
       local to the context pushed by the `proc' macro and popped by the
       `endproc' macro, so that the same argument name can be used in later
       procedures. Of course, you don't _have_ to do that.

       `arg' can take an optional parameter, giving the size of the
       argument. If no size is given, 4 is assumed, since it is likely that
       many function parameters will be of type `int' or pointers.

  11.2 Writing NetBSD/FreeBSD/OpenBSD and Linux/ELF Shared Libraries

       ELF replaced the older `a.out' object file format under Linux
       because it contains support for position-independent code (PIC),
       which makes writing shared libraries much easier. NASM supports the
       `ELF' position-independent code features, so you can write Linux
       `ELF' shared libraries in NASM.

       NetBSD, and its close cousins FreeBSD and OpenBSD, take a different
       approach by hacking PIC support into the `a.out' format. NASM
       supports this as the `aoutb' output format, so you can write BSD
       shared libraries in NASM too.

       The operating system loads a PIC shared library by memory-mapping
       the library file at an arbitrarily chosen point in the address space
       of the running process. The contents of the library's code section
       must therefore not depend on where it is loaded in memory.

       Therefore, you cannot get at your variables by writing code like
       this:

               mov     eax,[myvar]             ; WRONG

       Instead, the linker provides an area of memory called the _global
       offset table_, or GOT; the GOT is situated at a constant distance
       from your library's code, so if you can find out where your library
       is loaded (which is typically done using a `CALL' and `POP'
       combination), you can obtain the address of the GOT, and you can
       then load the addresses of your variables out of linker-generated
       entries in the GOT.

       The _data_ section of a PIC shared library does not have these
       restrictions: since the data section is writable, it has to be
       copied into memory anyway rather than just paged in from the library
       file, so as long as it's being copied it can be relocated too. So
       you can put ordinary types of relocation in the data section without
       too much worry (but see section 11.2.4 for a caveat).

11.2.1 Obtaining the Address of the GOT

       Each code module in your shared library should define the GOT as an
       external symbol:

       extern  _GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_   ; in ELF 
       extern  __GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_  ; in BSD a.out

       At the beginning of any function in your shared library which plans
       to access your data or BSS sections, you must first calculate the
       address of the GOT. This is typically done by writing the function
       in this form:

       func:   push    ebp 
               mov     ebp,esp 
               push    ebx 
               call    .get_GOT 
       .get_GOT: 
               pop     ebx 
               add     ebx,_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_+$$-.get_GOT wrt ..gotpc 
       
               ; the function body comes here 
       
               mov     ebx,[ebp-4] 
               mov     esp,ebp 
               pop     ebp 
               ret

       (For BSD, again, the symbol `_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE' requires a second
       leading underscore.)

       The first two lines of this function are simply the standard C
       prologue to set up a stack frame, and the last three lines are
       standard C function epilogue. The third line, and the fourth to last
       line, save and restore the `EBX' register, because PIC shared
       libraries use this register to store the address of the GOT.

       The interesting bit is the `CALL' instruction and the following two
       lines. The `CALL' and `POP' combination obtains the address of the
       label `.get_GOT', without having to know in advance where the
       program was loaded (since the `CALL' instruction is encoded relative
       to the current position). The `ADD' instruction makes use of one of
       the special PIC relocation types: GOTPC relocation. With the
       `WRT ..gotpc' qualifier specified, the symbol referenced (here
       `_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_', the special symbol assigned to the GOT) is
       given as an offset from the beginning of the section. (Actually,
       `ELF' encodes it as the offset from the operand field of the `ADD'
       instruction, but NASM simplifies this deliberately, so you do things
       the same way for both `ELF' and `BSD'.) So the instruction then
       _adds_ the beginning of the section, to get the real address of the
       GOT, and subtracts the value of `.get_GOT' which it knows is in
       `EBX'. Therefore, by the time that instruction has finished, `EBX'
       contains the address of the GOT.

       If you didn't follow that, don't worry: it's never necessary to
       obtain the address of the GOT by any other means, so you can put
       those three instructions into a macro and safely ignore them:

       %macro  get_GOT 0 
       
               call    %%getgot 
         %%getgot: 
               pop     ebx 
               add     ebx,_GLOBAL_OFFSET_TABLE_+$$-%%getgot wrt ..gotpc 
       
       %endmacro

11.2.2 Finding Your Local Data Items

       Having got the GOT, you can then use it to obtain the addresses of
       your data items. Most variables will reside in the sections you have
       declared; they can be accessed using the `..gotoff' special `WRT'
       type. The way this works is like this:

               lea     eax,[ebx+myvar wrt ..gotoff]

       The expression `myvar wrt ..gotoff' is calculated, when the shared
       library is linked, to be the offset to the local variable `myvar'
       from the beginning of the GOT. Therefore, adding it to `EBX' as
       above will place the real address of `myvar' in `EAX'.

       If you declare variables as `GLOBAL' without specifying a size for
       them, they are shared between code modules in the library, but do
       not get exported from the library to the program that loaded it.
       They will still be in your ordinary data and BSS sections, so you
       can access them in the same way as local variables, using the above
       `..gotoff' mechanism.

       Note that due to a peculiarity of the way BSD `a.out' format handles
       this relocation type, there must be at least one non-local symbol in
       the same section as the address you're trying to access.

11.2.3 Finding External and Common Data Items

       If your library needs to get at an external variable (external to
       the _library_, not just to one of the modules within it), you must
       use the `..got' type to get at it. The `..got' type, instead of
       giving you the offset from the GOT base to the variable, gives you
       the offset from the GOT base to a GOT _entry_ containing the address
       of the variable. The linker will set up this GOT entry when it
       builds the library, and the dynamic linker will place the correct
       address in it at load time. So to obtain the address of an external
       variable `extvar' in `EAX', you would code

               mov     eax,[ebx+extvar wrt ..got]

       This loads the address of `extvar' out of an entry in the GOT. The
       linker, when it builds the shared library, collects together every
       relocation of type `..got', and builds the GOT so as to ensure it
       has every necessary entry present.

       Common variables must also be accessed in this way.

11.2.4 Exporting Symbols to the Library User

       If you want to export symbols to the user of the library, you have
       to declare whether they are functions or data, and if they are data,
       you have to give the size of the data item. This is because the
       dynamic linker has to build _procedure linkage table_ entries for
       any exported functions, and also moves exported data items away from
       the library's data section in which they were declared.

       So to export a function to users of the library, you must use

       global  func:function           ; declare it as a function 
       
       func:   push    ebp 
       
               ; etc.

       And to export a data item such as an array, you would have to code

       global  array:data array.end-array      ; give the size too 
       
       array:  resd    128 
       .end:

       Be careful: If you export a variable to the library user, by
       declaring it as `GLOBAL' and supplying a size, the variable will end
       up living in the data section of the main program, rather than in
       your library's data section, where you declared it. So you will have
       to access your own global variable with the `..got' mechanism rather
       than `..gotoff', as if it were external (which, effectively, it has
       become).

       Equally, if you need to store the address of an exported global in
       one of your data sections, you can't do it by means of the standard
       sort of code:

       dataptr:        dd      global_data_item        ; WRONG

       NASM will interpret this code as an ordinary relocation, in which
       `global_data_item' is merely an offset from the beginning of the
       `.data' section (or whatever); so this reference will end up
       pointing at your data section instead of at the exported global
       which resides elsewhere.

       Instead of the above code, then, you must write

       dataptr:        dd      global_data_item wrt ..sym

       which makes use of the special `WRT' type `..sym' to instruct NASM
       to search the symbol table for a particular symbol at that address,
       rather than just relocating by section base.

       Either method will work for functions: referring to one of your
       functions by means of

       funcptr:        dd      my_function

       will give the user the address of the code you wrote, whereas

       funcptr:        dd      my_function wrt ..sym

       will give the address of the procedure linkage table for the
       function, which is where the calling program will _believe_ the
       function lives. Either address is a valid way to call the function.

11.2.5 Calling Procedures Outside the Library

       Calling procedures outside your shared library has to be done by
       means of a _procedure linkage table_, or PLT. The PLT is placed at a
       known offset from where the library is loaded, so the library code
       can make calls to the PLT in a position-independent way. Within the
       PLT there is code to jump to offsets contained in the GOT, so
       function calls to other shared libraries or to routines in the main
       program can be transparently passed off to their real destinations.

       To call an external routine, you must use another special PIC
       relocation type, `WRT ..plt'. This is much easier than the GOT-based
       ones: you simply replace calls such as `CALL printf' with the PLT-
       relative version `CALL printf WRT ..plt'.

11.2.6 Generating the Library File

       Having written some code modules and assembled them to `.o' files,
       you then generate your shared library with a command such as

       ld -shared -o library.so module1.o module2.o       # for ELF 
       ld -Bshareable -o library.so module1.o module2.o   # for BSD

       For ELF, if your shared library is going to reside in system
       directories such as `/usr/lib' or `/lib', it is usually worth using
       the `-soname' flag to the linker, to store the final library file
       name, with a version number, into the library:

       ld -shared -soname library.so.1 -o library.so.1.2 *.o

       You would then copy `library.so.1.2' into the library directory, and
       create `library.so.1' as a symbolic link to it.

Chapter 12: Mixing 16- and 32-bit Code
--------------------------------------

       This chapter tries to cover some of the issues, largely related to
       unusual forms of addressing and jump instructions, encountered when
       writing operating system code such as protected-mode initialization
       routines, which require code that operates in mixed segment sizes,
       such as code in a 16-bit segment trying to modify data in a 32-bit
       one, or jumps between different-size segments.

  12.1 Mixed-Size Jumps

       The most common form of mixed-size instruction is the one used when
       writing a 32-bit OS: having done your setup in 16-bit mode, such as
       loading the kernel, you then have to boot it by switching into
       protected mode and jumping to the 32-bit kernel start address. In a
       fully 32-bit OS, this tends to be the _only_ mixed-size instruction
       you need, since everything before it can be done in pure 16-bit
       code, and everything after it can be pure 32-bit.

       This jump must specify a 48-bit far address, since the target
       segment is a 32-bit one. However, it must be assembled in a 16-bit
       segment, so just coding, for example,

               jmp     0x1234:0x56789ABC       ; wrong!

       will not work, since the offset part of the address will be
       truncated to `0x9ABC' and the jump will be an ordinary 16-bit far
       one.

       The Linux kernel setup code gets round the inability of `as86' to
       generate the required instruction by coding it manually, using `DB'
       instructions. NASM can go one better than that, by actually
       generating the right instruction itself. Here's how to do it right:

               jmp     dword 0x1234:0x56789ABC         ; right

       The `DWORD' prefix (strictly speaking, it should come _after_ the
       colon, since it is declaring the _offset_ field to be a doubleword;
       but NASM will accept either form, since both are unambiguous) forces
       the offset part to be treated as far, in the assumption that you are
       deliberately writing a jump from a 16-bit segment to a 32-bit one.

       You can do the reverse operation, jumping from a 32-bit segment to a
       16-bit one, by means of the `WORD' prefix:

               jmp     word 0x8765:0x4321      ; 32 to 16 bit

       If the `WORD' prefix is specified in 16-bit mode, or the `DWORD'
       prefix in 32-bit mode, they will be ignored, since each is
       explicitly forcing NASM into a mode it was in anyway.

  12.2 Addressing Between Different-Size Segments

       If your OS is mixed 16 and 32-bit, or if you are writing a DOS
       extender, you are likely to have to deal with some 16-bit segments
       and some 32-bit ones. At some point, you will probably end up
       writing code in a 16-bit segment which has to access data in a 32-
       bit segment, or vice versa.

       If the data you are trying to access in a 32-bit segment lies within
       the first 64K of the segment, you may be able to get away with using
       an ordinary 16-bit addressing operation for the purpose; but sooner
       or later, you will want to do 32-bit addressing from 16-bit mode.

       The easiest way to do this is to make sure you use a register for
       the address, since any effective address containing a 32-bit
       register is forced to be a 32-bit address. So you can do

               mov     eax,offset_into_32_bit_segment_specified_by_fs 
               mov     dword [fs:eax],0x11223344

       This is fine, but slightly cumbersome (since it wastes an
       instruction and a register) if you already know the precise offset
       you are aiming at. The x86 architecture does allow 32-bit effective
       addresses to specify nothing but a 4-byte offset, so why shouldn't
       NASM be able to generate the best instruction for the purpose?

       It can. As in section 12.1, you need only prefix the address with
       the `DWORD' keyword, and it will be forced to be a 32-bit address:

               mov     dword [fs:dword my_offset],0x11223344

       Also as in section 12.1, NASM is not fussy about whether the `DWORD'
       prefix comes before or after the segment override, so arguably a
       nicer-looking way to code the above instruction is

               mov     dword [dword fs:my_offset],0x11223344

       Don't confuse the `DWORD' prefix _outside_ the square brackets,
       which controls the size of the data stored at the address, with the
       one `inside' the square brackets which controls the length of the
       address itself. The two can quite easily be different:

               mov     word [dword 0x12345678],0x9ABC

       This moves 16 bits of data to an address specified by a 32-bit
       offset.

       You can also specify `WORD' or `DWORD' prefixes along with the `FAR'
       prefix to indirect far jumps or calls. For example:

               call    dword far [fs:word 0x4321]

       This instruction contains an address specified by a 16-bit offset;
       it loads a 48-bit far pointer from that (16-bit segment and 32-bit
       offset), and calls that address.

  12.3 Other Mixed-Size Instructions

       The other way you might want to access data might be using the
       string instructions (`LODSx', `STOSx' and so on) or the `XLATB'
       instruction. These instructions, since they take no parameters,
       might seem to have no easy way to make them perform 32-bit
       addressing when assembled in a 16-bit segment.

       This is the purpose of NASM's `a16', `a32' and `a64' prefixes. If
       you are coding `LODSB' in a 16-bit segment but it is supposed to be
       accessing a string in a 32-bit segment, you should load the desired
       address into `ESI' and then code

               a32     lodsb

       The prefix forces the addressing size to 32 bits, meaning that
       `LODSB' loads from `[DS:ESI]' instead of `[DS:SI]'. To access a
       string in a 16-bit segment when coding in a 32-bit one, the
       corresponding `a16' prefix can be used.

       The `a16', `a32' and `a64' prefixes can be applied to any
       instruction in NASM's instruction table, but most of them can
       generate all the useful forms without them. The prefixes are
       necessary only for instructions with implicit addressing: `CMPSx',
       `SCASx', `LODSx', `STOSx', `MOVSx', `INSx', `OUTSx', and `XLATB'.
       Also, the various push and pop instructions (`PUSHA' and `POPF' as
       well as the more usual `PUSH' and `POP') can accept `a16', `a32' or
       `a64' prefixes to force a particular one of `SP', `ESP' or `RSP' to
       be used as a stack pointer, in case the stack segment in use is a
       different size from the code segment.

       `PUSH' and `POP', when applied to segment registers in 32-bit mode,
       also have the slightly odd behaviour that they push and pop 4 bytes
       at a time, of which the top two are ignored and the bottom two give
       the value of the segment register being manipulated. To force the
       16-bit behaviour of segment-register push and pop instructions, you
       can use the operand-size prefix `o16':

               o16 push    ss 
               o16 push    ds

       This code saves a doubleword of stack space by fitting two segment
       registers into the space which would normally be consumed by pushing
       one.

       (You can also use the `o32' prefix to force the 32-bit behaviour
       when in 16-bit mode, but this seems less useful.)

Chapter 13: Writing 64-bit Code (Unix, Win64)
---------------------------------------------

       This chapter attempts to cover some of the common issues involved
       when writing 64-bit code, to run under Win64 or Unix. It covers how
       to write assembly code to interface with 64-bit C routines, and how
       to write position-independent code for shared libraries.

       All 64-bit code uses a flat memory model, since segmentation is not
       available in 64-bit mode. The one exception is the `FS' and `GS'
       registers, which still add their bases.

       Position independence in 64-bit mode is significantly simpler, since
       the processor supports `RIP'-relative addressing directly; see the
       `REL' keyword (section 3.3). On most 64-bit platforms, it is
       probably desirable to make that the default, using the directive
       `DEFAULT REL' (section 8.2).

       `DEFAULT REL' is likely to become the default in a future version of
       NASM.

       64-bit programming is relatively similar to 32-bit programming, but
       of course pointers are 64 bits long; additionally, all existing
       platforms pass arguments in registers rather than on the stack.
       Furthermore, 64-bit platforms use SSE2 by default for floating
       point. Please see the ABI documentation for your platform.

       64-bit platforms differ in the sizes of the C/C++ fundamental
       datatypes, not just from 32-bit platforms but from each other. If a
       specific size data type is desired, it is probably best to use the
       types defined in the standard C header `<inttypes.h>'.

       All known 64-bit platforms except some embedded platforms require
       that the stack is 16-byte aligned at the entry to a function.
       Specifically, the stack pointer (`RSP') needs to be 16-byte aligned
       just before the `CALL' instruction.

       In 64-bit mode, the default instruction size is still 32 bits. When
       loading a value into a 32-bit register (but not an 8- or 16-bit
       register), the upper 32 bits of the corresponding 64-bit register
       are set to zero.

  13.1 Register Names in 64-bit Mode

       NASM uses the following names for general-purpose registers in 64-
       bit mode, for 8-, 16-, 32- and 64-bit references, respectively:

            AL/AH, CL/CH, DL/DH, BL/BH, SPL, BPL, SIL, DIL, R8B-R15B 
            AX, CX, DX, BX, SP, BP, SI, DI, R8W-R15W 
            EAX, ECX, EDX, EBX, ESP, EBP, ESI, EDI, R8D-R15D 
            RAX, RCX, RDX, RBX, RSP, RBP, RSI, RDI, R8-R15

       This is consistent with the AMD documentation and most other
       assemblers. The Intel documentation, however, uses the names
       `R8L-R15L' for 8-bit references to the higher registers. It is
       possible to use those names by defining them as macros; similarly,
       if one wants to use numeric names for the low 8 registers, define
       them as macros. The standard macro package `altreg' (see section
       7.1) can be used for this purpose.

  13.2 Immediates and Displacements in 64-bit Mode

       In 64-bit mode, immediates and displacements are generally only 32
       bits wide. NASM will therefore truncate most displacements and
       immediates to 32 bits.

13.2.1 Immediate 64-bit Operands

       The only instruction which takes a full 64-bit immediate is:

            MOV reg64,imm64

       NASM will produce this instruction whenever the programmer uses
       `MOV' with an immediate into a 64-bit register. If this is not
       desirable, simply specify the equivalent 32-bit register, which will
       be automatically zero-extended by the processor, or specify the
       immediate as `DWORD':

            mov rax,foo             ; 64-bit immediate 
            mov rax,qword foo       ; (identical) 
            mov eax,foo             ; 32-bit immediate, zero-extended 
            mov rax,dword foo       ; 32-bit immediate, sign-extended

       The length of these instructions are 10, 5 and 7 bytes,
       respectively.

       If optimization is enabled and NASM can determine at assembly time
       that a shorter instruction will suffice, the shorter instruction
       will be emitted unless of course `STRICT QWORD' or `STRICT DWORD' is
       specified (see section 3.7):

            mov rax,1               ; Assembles as "mov eax,1" (5 bytes) 
            mov rax,strict qword 1  ; Full 10-byte instruction 
            mov rax,strict dword 1  ; 7-byte instruction 
            mov rax,symbol          ; 10 bytes, not known at assembly time 
            lea rax,[rel symbol]    ; 7 bytes, usually preferred by the ABI

       Note that `lea rax,[rel symbol]' is position-independent, whereas
       `mov rax,symbol' is not. Most ABIs prefer or even require position-
       independent code in 64-bit mode. However, the `MOV' instruction is
       able to reference a symbol anywhere in the 64-bit address space,
       whereas `LEA' is only able to access a symbol within within 2 GB of
       the instruction itself (see below).

13.2.2 64-bit Displacements

       The only instructions which take a full 64-bit _displacement_ is
       loading or storing, using `MOV', `AL', `AX', `EAX' or `RAX' (but no
       other registers) to an absolute 64-bit address. Since this is a
       relatively rarely used instruction (64-bit code generally uses
       relative addressing), the programmer has to explicitly declare the
       displacement size as `ABS QWORD':

            default abs 
       
            mov eax,[foo]           ; 32-bit absolute disp, sign-extended 
            mov eax,[a32 foo]       ; 32-bit absolute disp, zero-extended 
            mov eax,[qword foo]     ; 64-bit absolute disp 
       
            default rel 
       
            mov eax,[foo]           ; 32-bit relative disp 
            mov eax,[a32 foo]       ; d:o, address truncated to 32 bits(!) 
            mov eax,[qword foo]     ; error 
            mov eax,[abs qword foo] ; 64-bit absolute disp

       A sign-extended absolute displacement can access from -2 GB to +2
       GB; a zero-extended absolute displacement can access from 0 to 4 GB.

  13.3 Interfacing to 64-bit C Programs (Unix)

       On Unix, the 64-bit ABI as well as the x32 ABI (32-bit ABI with the
       CPU in 64-bit mode) is defined by the documents at:

       `https://www.nasm.us/abi/unix64'

       Although written for AT&T-syntax assembly, the concepts apply
       equally well for NASM-style assembly. What follows is a simplified
       summary.

       The first six integer arguments (from the left) are passed in `RDI',
       `RSI', `RDX', `RCX', `R8', and `R9', in that order. Additional
       integer arguments are passed on the stack. These registers, plus
       `RAX', `R10' and `R11' are destroyed by function calls, and thus are
       available for use by the function without saving.

       Integer return values are passed in `RAX' and `RDX', in that order.

       Floating point is done using SSE registers, except for
       `long double', which is 80 bits (`TWORD') on most platforms (Android
       is one exception; there `long double' is 64 bits and treated the
       same as `double'.) Floating-point arguments are passed in `XMM0' to
       `XMM7'; return is `XMM0' and `XMM1'. `long double' are passed on the
       stack, and returned in `ST0' and `ST1'.

       All SSE and x87 registers are destroyed by function calls.

       On 64-bit Unix, `long' is 64 bits.

       Integer and SSE register arguments are counted separately, so for
       the case of

            void foo(long a, double b, int c)

       `a' is passed in `RDI', `b' in `XMM0', and `c' in `ESI'.

  13.4 Interfacing to 64-bit C Programs (Win64)

       The Win64 ABI is described by the document at:

       `https://www.nasm.us/abi/win64'

       What follows is a simplified summary.

       The first four integer arguments are passed in `RCX', `RDX', `R8'
       and `R9', in that order. Additional integer arguments are passed on
       the stack. These registers, plus `RAX', `R10' and `R11' are
       destroyed by function calls, and thus are available for use by the
       function without saving.

       Integer return values are passed in `RAX' only.

       Floating point is done using SSE registers, except for
       `long double'. Floating-point arguments are passed in `XMM0' to
       `XMM3'; return is `XMM0' only.

       On Win64, `long' is 32 bits; `long long' or `_int64' is 64 bits.

       Integer and SSE register arguments are counted together, so for the
       case of

            void foo(long long a, double b, int c)

       `a' is passed in `RCX', `b' in `XMM1', and `c' in `R8D'.

       There is a requirement for functions to allocate a "shadow space"
       for callees, prior to calling them, that is owned by the callee.
       This is for the callee to (optionally) store the arguments that are
       passed in via registers (e.g. for debugging purposes), or in fact
       any other desired values. This 32-byte shadow space must be
       allocated just before the stack space used for non-register
       arguments (5th and beyond, if any).

       Before a function call, 16-byte stack alignment is required.

       Regarding shadow space and stack alignment, an exception is made for
       leaf functions, which in Win64 terms means no modification to `RSP'
       at all (not just having no function calls).

Chapter 14: Troubleshooting
---------------------------

       This chapter describes some of the common problems that users have
       been known to encounter with NASM, and answers them. If you think
       you have found a bug in NASM, please see section E.2.

  14.1 Common Problems

14.1.1 NASM Generates Inefficient Code

       We sometimes get `bug' reports about NASM generating inefficient, or
       even `wrong', code on instructions such as `ADD ESP,8'. This is a
       deliberate design feature, connected to predictability of output:
       NASM, on seeing `ADD ESP,8', will generate the form of the
       instruction which leaves room for a 32-bit offset. You need to code
       `ADD ESP,BYTE 8' if you want the space-efficient form of the
       instruction. This isn't a bug, it's user error: if you prefer to
       have NASM produce the more efficient code automatically enable
       optimization with the `-O' option (see section 2.1.24).

14.1.2 My Jumps are Out of Range

       Similarly, people complain that when they issue conditional jumps
       (which are `SHORT' by default) that try to jump too far, NASM
       reports `short jump out of range' instead of making the jumps
       longer.

       This, again, is partly a predictability issue, but in fact has a
       more practical reason as well. NASM has no means of being told what
       type of processor the code it is generating will be run on; so it
       cannot decide for itself that it should generate `Jcc NEAR' type
       instructions, because it doesn't know that it's working for a 386 or
       above. Alternatively, it could replace the out-of-range short `JNE'
       instruction with a very short `JE' instruction that jumps over a
       `JMP NEAR'; this is a sensible solution for processors below a 386,
       but hardly efficient on processors which have good branch prediction
       _and_ could have used `JNE NEAR' instead. So, once again, it's up to
       the user, not the assembler, to decide what instructions should be
       generated. See section 2.1.24.

14.1.3 `ORG' Doesn't Work

       People writing boot sector programs in the `bin' format often
       complain that `ORG' doesn't work the way they'd like: in order to
       place the `0xAA55' signature word at the end of a 512-byte boot
       sector, people who are used to MASM tend to code

               ORG 0 
       
               ; some boot sector code 
       
               ORG 510 
               DW 0xAA55

       This is not the intended use of the `ORG' directive in NASM, and
       will not work. The correct way to solve this problem in NASM is to
       use the `TIMES' directive, like this:

               ORG 0 
       
               ; some boot sector code 
       
               TIMES 510-($-$$) DB 0 
               DW 0xAA55

       The `TIMES' directive will insert exactly enough zero bytes into the
       output to move the assembly point up to 510. This method also has
       the advantage that if you accidentally fill your boot sector too
       full, NASM will catch the problem at assembly time and report it, so
       you won't end up with a boot sector that you have to disassemble to
       find out what's wrong with it.

14.1.4 `TIMES' Doesn't Work

       The other common problem with the above code is people who write the
       `TIMES' line as

               TIMES 510-$ DB 0

       by reasoning that `$' should be a pure number, just like 510, so the
       difference between them is also a pure number and can happily be fed
       to `TIMES'.

       NASM is a _modular_ assembler: the various component parts are
       designed to be easily separable for re-use, so they don't exchange
       information unnecessarily. In consequence, the `bin' output format,
       even though it has been told by the `ORG' directive that the `.text'
       section should start at 0, does not pass that information back to
       the expression evaluator. So from the evaluator's point of view, `$'
       isn't a pure number: it's an offset from a section base. Therefore
       the difference between `$' and 510 is also not a pure number, but
       involves a section base. Values involving section bases cannot be
       passed as arguments to `TIMES'.

       The solution, as in the previous section, is to code the `TIMES'
       line in the form

               TIMES 510-($-$$) DB 0

       in which `$' and `$$' are offsets from the same section base, and so
       their difference is a pure number. This will solve the problem and
       generate sensible code.

Appendix A: List of Warning Classes
-----------------------------------

       These are the warning classes currently defined by NASM for the
       purpose of enabling, disabling and promoting to error. See section
       2.1.26 and section 8.14.

   A.1 Warning Classes

       This list shows each warning class that can be enabled or disabled
       individually. Each warning containing a `-' character in the name
       can also be enabled or disabled as part of a group, named by
       removing one or more `-'-delimited suffixes.

 A.1.1 Enabled by default

       (*)  `db-empty': no operand for data declaration

           Warns about a `D'_x_ declaration with no operands, producing no
           output. This is permitted, but often indicative of an error. See
           section 3.2.1.

       (*)  `ea-absolute': absolute address cannot be RIP-relative

           Warns that an address that is inherently absolute cannot be
           generated with RIP-relative encoding using `REL', see section
           8.2.1.

       (*)  `ea-dispsize': displacement size ignored on absolute address

           Warns that NASM does not support generating displacements for
           inherently absolute addresses that do not match the address size
           of the instruction.

       (*)  `float-overflow': floating point overflow

           Warns about floating point underflow.

       (*)  `float-toolong': too many digits in floating-point number

           Warns about too many digits in floating-point numbers.

       (*)  `forward': forward reference may have unpredictable results

           Warns that a forward reference is used which may have
           unpredictable results, notably in a `RESB'-type pseudo-
           instruction. These would be _critical expressions_ (see section
           3.8) but are permitted in a handful of cases for compatibility
           with older versions of NASM. This warning should be treated as a
           severe programming error as the code could break at any time for
           any number of reasons.

       (*)  `implicit-abs-deprecated': implicit DEFAULT ABS is deprecated

           Warns that in a future version of NASM, the 64-bit default
           addressing form is likely to change from `DEFAULT ABS' to
           `DEFAULT REL'. If absolute addressing is indeed intended, it is
           strongly recommended to specify `DEFAULT ABS' explicitly.

       (*)  `label-orphan': labels alone on lines without trailing `:'

           Warns about source lines which contain no instruction but define
           a label without a trailing colon. This is most likely indicative
           of a typo, but is technically correct NASM syntax (see section
           3.1.)

       (*)  `number-deprecated-hex': $ prefix for hexadecimal is deprecated

           Warns that the `$' prefix for hexadecimal numbers is deprecated,
           due to the syntactic conflict with `$' used as a symbol escape
           prefix. This syntax may be disabled by default in a future
           version of NASM. Replace `$' with `0x' to ensure compatibility
           with future versions.

       (*)  `number-overflow': numeric constant does not fit

           Covers warnings about numeric constants which don't fit in 64
           bits.

       (*)  `obsolete-nop': instruction obsolete and is a noop on the
           target CPU

           Warns for an instruction which has been removed from the
           architecture, but has been architecturally defined to be a noop
           for future CPUs.

       (*)  `obsolete-removed': instruction obsolete and removed on the
           target CPU

           Warns for an instruction which has been removed from the
           architecture, and is no longer included in the CPU definition
           given in the `[CPU]' directive, for example `POP CS', the opcode
           for which, `0Fh', instead is an opcode prefix on CPUs newer than
           the first generation 8086.

       (*)  `obsolete-valid': instruction obsolete but valid on the target
           CPU

           Warns for an instruction which has been removed from the
           architecture, but is still valid on the specific CPU given in
           the `CPU' directive. Code using these instructions is most
           likely not forward compatible.

       (*)  `other': any warning not assigned to a specific warning class

           Specifies any warning not included in any specific warning
           class.

       (*)  `pp-else-elif': `%elif' after `%else'

           Warns that an `%elif'-type directive was encountered after
           `%else' has already been encounted. As a result, the content of
           the `%elif' will never be expanded.

       (*)  `pp-else-else': `%else' after `%else'

           Warns that a second `%else' clause was found for the same `%if'
           statement. The content of this `%else' clause will never be
           expanded.

       (*)  `pp-empty-braces': empty `%{}' construct

           Warns that an empty `%{}' was encountered. This expands to a
           single `%' character, which is normally the `%' arithmetic
           operator.

       (*)  `pp-environment': nonexistent environment variable

           Warns if a nonexistent environment variable is accessed using
           the `%!' preprocessor construct (see section 5.13.2.) Such
           environment variables are treated as empty (with this warning
           issued) starting in NASM 2.15; earlier versions of NASM would
           treat this as an error.

       (*)  `pp-macro-def-case-single': single-line macro defined both case
           sensitive and insensitive

           Warns when a single-line macro is defined both case sensitive
           and case insensitive. The new macro definition will override
           (shadow) the original one, although the original macro is not
           deleted, and will be re-exposed if the new macro is deleted with
           `%undef', or, if the original macro is the case insensitive one,
           the macro call is done with a different case.

       (*)  `pp-macro-def-greedy-single': single-line macro

           Warns that a single-line macro is defined which would match a
           previously existing greedy definition. The new macro definition
           will override (shadow) the original one, although the original
           macro is not deleted, and will be re-exposed if the new macro is
           deleted with `%undef', and will be invoked if called with a
           parameter count that does not match the new definition.

       (*)  `pp-macro-defaults': macros with more default than optional
           parameters

           Warns when a macro has more default parameters than optional
           parameters. See section 5.5.5 for why one might want to disable
           this warning.

       (*)  `pp-macro-params-legacy': improperly calling multi-line macro
           for legacy support

           Warns about multi-line macros being invoked with the wrong
           number of parameters, but for bug-compatibility with NASM
           versions older than 2.15, NASM tried to fix up the parameters to
           match the legacy behavior and call the macro anyway. This can
           happen in certain cases where there are empty arguments without
           braces, sometimes as a result of macro expansion.

           The legacy behavior is quite strange and highly context-
           dependent, and can be disabled with:

            %pragma preproc sane_empty_expansion true

           It is highly recommended to use this option in new code.

       (*)  `pp-macro-params-multi': multi-line macro calls with wrong
           parameter count

           Warns about multi-line macros being invoked with the wrong
           number of parameters. See section 5.5.1 for an example of why
           you might want to disable this warning.

       (*)  `pp-macro-params-single': single-line macro calls with wrong
           parameter count

           Warns about single-line macros being invoked with the wrong
           number of parameters.

       (*)  `pp-macro-redef-multi': redefining multi-line macro

           Warns that a multi-line macro is being redefined, without first
           removing the old definition with `%unmacro'.

       (*)  `pp-open-braces': unterminated `%{...}'

           Warns that a preprocessor parameter enclosed in braces `%{...}'
           lacks the terminating `}' character.

       (*)  `pp-open-brackets': unterminated `%[...]'

           Warns that a preprocessor `%[...]' construct lacks the
           terminating `]' character.

       (*)  `pp-open-string': unterminated string

           Warns that a quoted string without a closing quotation mark was
           encountered during preprocessing.

       (*)  `pp-rep-negative': regative `%rep' count

           Warns about a negative count given to the `%rep' preprocessor
           directive.

       (*)  `pp-sel-range': `%sel()' argument out of range

           Warns that the `%sel()' preprocessor function was passed a value
           less than 1 or larger than the number of available arguments.

       (*)  `pp-trailing': trailing garbage ignored

           Warns that the preprocessor encountered additional text where no
           such text was expected. This can sometimes be the result of an
           incorrectly written expression, or arguments that are
           inadvertently separated.

       (*)  `prefix-bnd': invalid `BND' prefix

           Warns about ineffective use of the `BND' prefix when the `JMP'
           instruction is converted to the `SHORT' form. This should be
           extremely rare since the short `JMP' only is applicable to jumps
           inside the same module, but if it is legitimate, it may be
           necessary to use `bnd jmp dword'.

       (*)  `prefix-hint-dropped': invalid branch hint prefix dropped

           Warns that the `{PT'} (predict taken) or `{PN'} (predict not
           taken) branch prediction hint prefixes are specified on an
           instruction that does not take these prefixes. As these prefixes
           alias the segment override prefixes, this may be a very serious
           error, and therefore NASM will not generate these prefixes. To
           force these prefixes to be emitted, use `DS' or `CS', instead,
           respectively.

       (*)  `prefix-hle': invalid HLE prefix

           Warns about invalid use of the HLE `XACQUIRE' or `XRELEASE'
           prefixes.

       (*)  `prefix-invalid': invalid prefix for instruction

           Warns about an instruction which is only valid with certain
           combinations of prefixes. The prefix will still be generated as
           requested, but the result may be a completely different
           instruction or result in a `#UD' trap.

       (*)  `prefix-lock-error': `LOCK' prefix on unlockable instruction

           Warns about `LOCK' prefixes specified on unlockable
           instructions.

       (*)  `prefix-lock-xchg': superfluous `LOCK' prefix on `XCHG'
           instruction

           Warns about a `LOCK' prefix added to an `XCHG' instruction. The
           `XCHG' instruction is _always_ locking, and so this prefix is
           not necessary; however, NASM will generate it if explicitly
           provided by the user, so this warning indicates that suboptimal
           code is being generated.

       (*)  `prefix-opsize': invalid operand size prefix

           Warns that an operand prefix (`o16', `o32', `o64', `osp')
           invalid for the specified instruction has been specified. The
           operand prefix will be ignored by the assembler.

       (*)  `prefix-seg': segment prefix ignored in 64-bit mode

           Warns that an `es', `cs', `ss' or `ds' segment override prefix
           has no effect in 64-bit mode. The prefix will still be generated
           as requested.

       (*)  `ptr': non-NASM keyword used in other assemblers

           Warns about keywords used in other assemblers that might
           indicate a mistake in the source code. Currently only the MASM
           `PTR' keyword is recognized. If (limited) MASM compatibility is
           desired, the `%use masm' macro package is available, see section
           7.5; however, carefully note the caveats listed.

       (*)  `regsize': register size specification ignored

           Warns about a register with implicit size (such as `EAX', which
           is always 32 bits) been given an explicit size specification
           which is inconsistent with the size of the named register, e.g.
           `WORD EAX'. `DWORD EAX' or `WORD AX' are permitted, and do not
           trigger this warning. Some registers which _do not_ imply a
           specific size, such as `K0', may need this specification unless
           the instruction itself implies the instruction size:

            KMOVW K0,[foo]          ; OK: KMOVW = 16 bits 
            KMOV  WORD K0,[foo]     ; OK: WORD K0 = 16 bits 
            KMOV  K0,WORD [foo]     ; OK: WORD [foo] = 16 bits 
            KMOV  K0,[foo]          ; Error: unknown size

       (*)  `section-alignment-rounded': section alignment rounded up

           Warn if a section alignment is specified which is not supported
           by the underlying object format, but can be rounded up to a
           supported value.

       (*)  `user': `%warning' directives

           Controls output of `%warning' directives (see section 5.11).

       (*)  `warn-stack-empty': warning stack empty

           A `[WARNING POP]' directive was executed when the warning stack
           is empty. This is treated as a `[WARNING *all]' directive.

       (*)  `zeroing': `RES'_x_ in initialized section becomes zero

           A `RES'_x_ directive was used in a section which contains
           initialized data, and the output format does not support this.
           Instead, this will be replaced with explicit zero content, which
           may produce a large output file.

       (*)  `zext-reloc': relocation zero-extended to match output format

           Warns that a relocation has been zero-extended due to
           limitations in the output format.

 A.1.2 Enabled and promoted to error by default

       (*)  `directive-garbage-eol': garbage after directive

           Text was found after a directive. This is a warning so it can be
           suppressed, because previous versions of NASM did not check for
           this condition.

       (*)  `label-redef-late': label (re)defined during code generation

           The value of a label changed during the final, code-generation
           pass. This may be the result of strange use of the preprocessor.
           This is very likely to produce incorrect code and may end up
           being an unconditional error in a future version of NASM.

       (*)  `pp-macro-def-param-single': single-line macro defined with and
           without parameters

           Warns if the same single-line macro is defined with and without
           parameters. The new macro definition will override (shadow) the
           original one, although the original macro is not deleted, and
           will be re-exposed if the new macro is deleted with `%undef'.

       (*)  `prefix-badmode-o64': o64 prefix invalid in 16/32-bit mode

           Warns that an `a64' prefix was specified in 16- or 32-bit mode.
           If the error is demoted to a warning or suppressed, the prefix
           is ignored by the assembler, but is likely to trigger futher
           errors.

 A.1.3 Disabled by default

       (*)  `float-denorm': floating point denormal

           Warns about denormal floating point constants.

       (*)  `float-underflow': floating point underflow

           Warns about floating point underflow (a nonzero constant rounded
           to zero.)

       (*)  `label-redef': label redefined to an identical value

           Warns if a label is defined more than once, but the value is
           identical. It is an unconditional error to define the same label
           more than once to _different_ values.

       (*)  `phase': phase error during stabilization

           Warns about symbols having changed values during the second-to-
           last assembly pass. This is not inherently fatal, but may be a
           source of bugs.

       (*)  `pragma-bad': malformed `%pragma'

           Warns about a malformed or otherwise unparsable `%pragma'
           directive.

       (*)  `pragma-empty': empty `%pragma' directive

           Warns about a `%pragma' directive containing nothing. This is
           treated identically to `%pragma ignore' except for this optional
           warning.

       (*)  `pragma-na': `%pragma' not applicable to this compilation

           Warns about a `%pragma' directive which is not applicable to
           this particular assembly session. This is not yet implemented.

       (*)  `pragma-unknown': unknown `%pragma' facility or directive

           Warns about an unknown `%pragma' directive. This is not yet
           implemented for most cases.

       (*)  `reloc-abs-byte': 8-bit absolute section-crossing relocation

           Warns that an 8-bit absolute relocation that could not be
           resolved at assembly time was generated in the output format.

           This is usually normal, but may not be handled by all possible
           target environments

       (*)  `reloc-abs-dword': 32-bit absolute section-crossing relocation

           Warns that a 32-bit absolute relocation that could not be
           resolved at assembly time was generated in the output format.

           This is usually normal, but may not be handled by all possible
           target environments

       (*)  `reloc-abs-qword': 64-bit absolute section-crossing relocation

           Warns that a 64-bit absolute relocation that could not be
           resolved at assembly time was generated in the output format.

           This is usually normal, but may not be handled by all possible
           target environments

       (*)  `reloc-abs-word': 16-bit absolute section-crossing relocation

           Warns that a 16-bit absolute relocation that could not be
           resolved at assembly time was generated in the output format.

           This is usually normal, but may not be handled by all possible
           target environments

       (*)  `reloc-rel-byte': 8-bit relative section-crossing relocation

           Warns that an 8-bit relative relocation that could not be
           resolved at assembly time was generated in the output format.

           This is usually normal, but may not be handled by all possible
           target environments

       (*)  `reloc-rel-dword': 32-bit relative section-crossing relocation

           Warns that a 32-bit relative relocation that could not be
           resolved at assembly time was generated in the output format.

           This is usually normal, but may not be handled by all possible
           target environments

       (*)  `reloc-rel-qword': 64-bit relative section-crossing relocation

           Warns that an 64-bit relative relocation that could not be
           resolved at assembly time was generated in the output format.

           This is usually normal, but may not be handled by all possible
           target environments

       (*)  `reloc-rel-word': 16-bit relative section-crossing relocation

           Warns that a 16-bit relative relocation that could not be
           resolved at assembly time was generated in the output format.

           This is usually normal, but may not be handled by all possible
           target environments

       (*)  `unknown-warning': unknown warning in `-W'/`-w' or warning
           directive

           Warns about a `-w' or `-W' option or a `[WARNING]' directive
           that contains an unknown warning name or is otherwise not
           possible to process.

   A.2 Warning Class Groups

       Warning class groups are aliases for all warning classes with a
       common prefix. This list shows the warnings that are currently
       included in specific warning groups.

       (*)  `all': all possible warnings

           `all' is an group alias for _all_ warning classes. Thus,
           `-w+all' enables all available warnings, and `-w-all' disables
           warnings entirely (since NASM 2.13).

       (*)  `ea': group alias for:

            ea-absolute 
            ea-dispsize

       (*)  `float': group alias for:

Appendix B: Ndisasm
-------------------

       The Netwide Disassembler, NDISASM

   B.1 Introduction

       The Netwide Disassembler is a small companion program to the Netwide
       Assembler, NASM. It seemed a shame to have an x86 assembler,
       complete with a full instruction table, and not make as much use of
       it as possible, so here's a disassembler which shares the
       instruction table (and some other bits of code) with NASM.

       The Netwide Disassembler does nothing except to produce
       disassemblies of _binary_ source files. NDISASM does not have any
       understanding of object file formats, like `objdump', and it will
       not understand DOS `.EXE' files like `debug' will. It just
       disassembles.

   B.2 Running NDISASM

       To disassemble a file, you will typically use a command of the form

              ndisasm -b {16|32|64} filename

       NDISASM can disassemble 16-, 32- or 64-bit code equally easily,
       provided of course that you remember to specify which it is to work
       with. If no `-b' switch is present, NDISASM works in 16-bit mode by
       default. The `-u' switch (for USE32) also invokes 32-bit mode.

       Two more command line options are `-r' which reports the version
       number of NDISASM you are running, and `-h' which gives a short
       summary of command line options.

 B.2.1 Specifying the Input Origin

       To disassemble a `DOS .COM' file correctly, a disassembler must
       assume that the first instruction in the file is loaded at address
       `0x100', rather than at zero. NDISASM, which assumes by default that
       any file you give it is loaded at zero, will therefore need to be
       informed of this.

       The `-o' option allows you to declare a different origin for the
       file you are disassembling. Its argument may be expressed in any of
       the NASM numeric formats: decimal by default, if it begins with
       ``$'' or ``0x'' or ends in ``H'' it's `hex', if it ends in ``Q''
       it's `octal', and if it ends in ``B'' it's `binary'.

       Hence, to disassemble a `.COM' file:

              ndisasm -o100h filename.com

       will do the trick.

 B.2.2 Code Following Data: Synchronization

       Suppose you are disassembling a file which contains some data which
       isn't machine code, and _then_ contains some machine code. NDISASM
       will faithfully plough through the data section, producing machine
       instructions wherever it can (although most of them will look
       bizarre, and some may have unusual prefixes, e.g.
       ``FS OR AX,0x240A''), and generating `DB' instructions ever so often
       if it's totally stumped. Then it will reach the code section.

       Supposing NDISASM has just finished generating a strange machine
       instruction from part of the data section, and its file position is
       now one byte _before_ the beginning of the code section. It's
       entirely possible that another spurious instruction will get
       generated, starting with the final byte of the data section, and
       then the correct first instruction in the code section will not be
       seen because the starting point skipped over it. This isn't really
       ideal.

       To avoid this, you can specify a `synchronization' point, or indeed
       as many synchronization points as you like (although NDISASM can
       only handle 2147483647 sync points internally). The definition of a
       sync point is this: NDISASM guarantees to hit sync points exactly
       during disassembly. If it is thinking about generating an
       instruction which would cause it to jump over a sync point, it will
       discard that instruction and output a ``db'' instead. So it _will_
       start disassembly exactly from the sync point, and so you _will_ see
       all the instructions in your code section.

       Sync points are specified using the `-s' option: they are measured
       in terms of the program origin, not the file position. So if you
       want to synchronize after 32 bytes of a `.COM' file, you would have
       to do

              ndisasm -o100h -s120h file.com

       rather than

              ndisasm -o100h -s20h file.com

       As stated above, you can specify multiple sync markers if you need
       to, just by repeating the `-s' option.

 B.2.3 Mixed Code and Data: Automatic (Intelligent) Synchronization 

       Suppose you are disassembling the boot sector of a `DOS' floppy
       (maybe it has a virus, and you need to understand the virus so that
       you know what kinds of damage it might have done you). Typically,
       this will contain a `JMP' instruction, then some data, then the rest
       of the code. So there is a very good chance of NDISASM being
       _misaligned_ when the data ends and the code begins. Hence a sync
       point is needed.

       On the other hand, why should you have to specify the sync point
       manually? What you'd do in order to find where the sync point would
       be, surely, would be to read the `JMP' instruction, and then to use
       its target address as a sync point. So can NDISASM do that for you?

       The answer, of course, is yes: using either of the synonymous
       switches `-a' (for automatic sync) or `-i' (for intelligent sync)
       will enable `auto-sync' mode. Auto-sync mode automatically generates
       a sync point for any forward-referring PC-relative jump or call
       instruction that NDISASM encounters. (Since NDISASM is one-pass, if
       it encounters a PC-relative jump whose target has already been
       processed, there isn't much it can do about it...)

       Only PC-relative jumps are processed, since an absolute jump is
       either through a register (in which case NDISASM doesn't know what
       the register contains) or involves a segment address (in which case
       the target code isn't in the same segment that NDISASM is working
       in, and so the sync point can't be placed anywhere useful).

       For some kinds of file, this mechanism will automatically put sync
       points in all the right places, and save you from having to place
       any sync points manually. However, it should be stressed that auto-
       sync mode is _not_ guaranteed to catch all the sync points, and you
       may still have to place some manually.

       Auto-sync mode doesn't prevent you from declaring manual sync
       points: it just adds automatically generated ones to the ones you
       provide. It's perfectly feasible to specify `-i' _and_ some `-s'
       options.

       Another caveat with auto-sync mode is that if, by some unpleasant
       fluke, something in your data section should disassemble to a PC-
       relative call or jump instruction, NDISASM may obediently place a
       sync point in a totally random place, for example in the middle of
       one of the instructions in your code section. So you may end up with
       a wrong disassembly even if you use auto-sync. Again, there isn't
       much I can do about this. If you have problems, you'll have to use
       manual sync points, or use the `-k' option (documented below) to
       suppress disassembly of the data area.

 B.2.4 Other Options

       The `-e' option skips a header on the file, by ignoring the first N
       bytes. This means that the header is _not_ counted towards the
       disassembly offset: if you give `-e10 -o10', disassembly will start
       at byte 10 in the file, and this will be given offset 10, not 20.

       The `-k' option is provided with two comma-separated numeric
       arguments, the first of which is an assembly offset and the second
       is a number of bytes to skip. This _will_ count the skipped bytes
       towards the assembly offset: its use is to suppress disassembly of a
       data section which wouldn't contain anything you wanted to see
       anyway.

Appendix C: NASM Version History
--------------------------------

   C.1 NASM 3 Series

       The NASM 3 series added support for the APX instruction encodings
       (extended GPRs), as well as preprocessor enhancements meant to make
       evolving code simpler.

       It is the production version of NASM since 2025.

 C.1.1 Version 3.01

       (*) A new `obj2' version of the `obj' output format, intended for
           use on OS/2. See section 9.5.

       (*) The condition after `%if' or `%elif' would be evaluated while
           output is suppressed after `%exitrep' or `%exitmacro'. Although
           no output would be generated in either case, assembly would fail
           if evaluating the expression triggered an error.

       (*) Fix encoding of `TCVTROWPS2PHL', correct multiple AVX512-BF16
           instructions' operand formats and typoed mnemonics.

       (*) The unofficial but obvious alternate form `TEST reg,mem' was not
           accepted by NASM 3.00; corrected.

       (*) For the `obj' output format, multiple `GROUP' directives can now
           be specified for the same group; the resulting group includes
           all sections specified in all `GROUP' directives for the group.

       (*) A new `%selbits()' preprocessor function. See section 5.4.19.

       (*) A new `--bits' option as convenience shorthand for
           `--before    "BITS ..."'. See section 2.1.31.

       (*) The options and pragmas for configuring external label mangling
           were inconsistent, the former using the spelling `postfix' and
           the latter `suffix'. Furthermore, these were also documented as
           _directives_ in addition to pragmas. Implement the already
           documented directives (bracketed forms only) and allow both
           `postfix' and `suffix' in all cases.

           See section 2.1.28 and section 8.10.

       (*) Define additional permissive patterns and fix several opcode
           bugs.

       (*) Fix parsing of two-operand forms of x87 instructions.

       (*) Fix bogus "absolute address can not be RIP-relative" warning.

       (*) Hopefully fix building with OpenWatcom.

       (*) Generate a warning, promoted to error by default, on the use of
           `o64' prefixes in 16- or 32-bit mode. If demoted to a warning or
           suppressed the prefix is ignored, but likely will trigger
           subsequent, harder to debug, error messages.

       (*) More consistent handling of jump and call instructions with
           specified operand sizes.

       (*) Fix an operand size handling bug in the `CMPXCHG' instruction.

 C.1.2 Version 3.00

       (*) Improve the documentation for building from source (appendix D).

       (*) Add support for the APX and AVX10 instruction sets, and various
           miscellaneous new instructions.

       (*) Add new preprocessor functions: `%b2hs()', `%chr()',
           `%depend()', `%find()', `%findi()', `%hs2b()', `%null()',
           `%ord()', `%pathsearch()', and `%realpath()'. See section 5.4.

       (*) New preprocessor directive `%note' to insert a note in the list
           file, without issuing an external diagnosic. Unlike a comment,
           it is optionally macro-expanded, see section 5.11.

       (*) New preprocessor directive `%iffile' (and corresponding function
           `%isfile()') to test for the existence of a file. See section
           5.6.12.

       (*) New preprocessor directive `%ifdirective' to test for the
           existence of a preprocessor directive, assembly directive, or
           pseudo-instruction; see section 5.6.10.

       (*) Fix a number of invalid memory references (usually causing
           crashes) on various invalid inputs.

       (*) Fix multiple bugs in the handling of `$'-escaped symbols.

       (*) The use of `$' as a prefix for hexadecimal numbers has been
           deprecated, and will now issue a warning. A new directive
           `[DOLLARHEX]' can be used to disable this syntax entirely, see
           section 8.12.

       (*) Fix the generation of segment selector references (mainly used
           in the `obj' output format.)

       (*) Fix crash in the `obj' backend when code was emitted into the
           default segment, without any labels having been defined.

       (*) Clean up the command-line help text (`-h') and break it down
           into individual topics, as the previous output was just too
           verbose to be practical as a quick reference.

       (*) The implicit `DEFAULT ABS' in 64-bit mode is deprecated and may
           be changed to `REL' in the future. See section 8.2. A warning is
           now emitted for this condition.

       (*) It is now possible to set the `REL'/`ABS' default for memory
           accesses using `FS:' or `GS:', see section 8.2.

       (*) The `__?DEFAULT?__' standard macro now reflects the settings of
           the `DEFAULT' directive. See section 6.4.

       (*) The NASM preprocessor now assumes that an unknown directive
           starting with `%if' or `%elif' is a misspelled or not yet
           implemented conditional directive, and tries to match it with a
           corresponding `%endif'. See section 5.6.14.

       (*) The `masm' macro package now defines a macro for x87 register
           syntax. See section 7.5.

       (*) A new macro package, `vtern', to simplify generation of the
           control immediates for the `VPTERNLOGD' and `VPTERNLOGQ'
           instructions. See section 7.6.

       (*) A new command line option `-LF' allows overriding `[LIST -]'
           directives.

       (*) In the `obj' output format, allow a segment in the `FLAT'
           pseudo-group to also belong to another (real) group. Used on
           OS/2.

       (*) Add a new `build_version' directive to the Mach-O backend. See
           section 9.9.6.

       (*) Fix a spec violation in the generation of DWARF debugging
           information on ELF.

       (*) Response files can now be nested.

       (*) Many documentation improvements.

   C.2 NASM 2 Series

       The NASM 2 series added support for x86-64, and was the production
       versions of NASM from 2007 to 2025.

 C.2.1 Version 2.16.03

       _This is a source build machinery and documentation update only.
       There are no functionality changes._

       (*) Fix building from `git' in a separate directory from the source.

       (*) Remove some irrelevant files from the source distribution.

       (*) Make the documentation stronger that `-O0' or `-O1' are probably
           not what the user wants. See section 2.1.24.

       (*) Fix `configure --enable-lto' build option.

       (*) Update the included RPM `.spec' file.

 C.2.2 Version 2.16.02

       (*) Fix building from the source distribution in a separate
           directory from the source.

       (*) Fix a number of issues when building from source, mostly
           involving `configure' or dependency generation.

           In particular, more aggressively avoid cross-compilation
           problems on Unix/Linux systems automatically invoking WINE. We
           could end up invoking WINE even when we didn't want to, making
           `configure' think it was running native when in fact cross-
           compiling.

       (*) Hopefully fix compiling with the latest versions of MSVC/nmake.

       (*) Windows host: add embedded manifest file. Without a manifest,
           Windows applications force a fixed `PATH_MAX' limit to any
           pathname; this is unnecessary.

       (*) Add support VEX-encoded SM4-NI instructions.

       (*) Add support for VEX-encoded SM3-NI instructions.

       (*) Add support for VEX-encoded SHA512-NI instructions.

       (*) `PTWRITE' opcode corrected (`F3' prefix required.)

       (*) Disassembler: the SMAP instructions are `NP'; notably the
           prefixed versions of `CLAC' are `ERETU'/`ERETS'.

       (*) Add support for Flexible Return and Exception Delivery (FRED):
           the `LKGS', `ERETS' and `ERETU' instructions.

       (*) Fix external references to segments in the `obj' (OMF) and
           possibly other output formats.

       (*) Always support up to 8 characters, i.e. 64 bits, in a string-to-
           numeric conversion.

       (*) Preprocessor: add `%map()' function to expand a macro from a
           list of arguments, see section 5.4.12.

       (*) Preprocessor: allow the user to specify the desired radix for an
           evaluated parameter. It doesn't make any direct difference, but
           can be nice for debugging or turning into strings. See the `='
           modifier in section 5.2.1.

       (*) Update documentation: `__USE_'_package_`__' is now
           `__?USE_'_package_`?__'.

       (*) Documentation: correct a minor problem in the expression grammar
           for `D'_x_ statements, see section 3.2.1.

       (*) Preprocessor: correctly handle empty `%rep' blocks.

       (*) Preprocessor: add options for a base prefix to `%num()', see
           section 5.4.14.

       (*) Preprocessor: add a `%hex()' function, equivalent to `%eval()'
           except that it producess hexadecimal values that are
           nevertheless valid NASM numeric constants, see section 5.4.9.

       (*) Preprocessor: fix the parameter number in error messages (should
           be 1-based, like `%'_num_ references to multi-line macro
           arguments.)

       (*) Documentation: be more clear than the `bin' format is simply a
           linker built into NASM. See section 9.1.

       (*) Adjust the `LOCK' prefix warning for `XCHG'.

           `LOCK XCHG '_reg_`,'_mem_ would issue a warning for being
           unlockable, which is incorrect. In this case the _reg_`,'_mem_
           encoding is simply an alias for the _mem_`,'_reg_ encoding.
           However, `XCHG' is _always_ locked, so create a new warning
           (`-w+prefix-lock-xchg') to explicitly flag a user-specified
           `LOCK XCHG'; default off. Future versions of NASM may remove the
           `LOCK' prefix when optimization is enabled.

       (*) Fix broken dependency-list generation.

       (*) Add optional warnings for specific relocation types
           (`-w+reloc-*', see appendix A), default off.

           Some target environments may have specific restrictions on what
           kinds of relocations are possible or allowed.

       (*) Error out on certain bad syntax in `D'_x_ statements, such as
           `db 1 2'. See section 3.2.1.

 C.2.3 Version 2.16.01

       _This is a documentation update release only. There are no
       functionality changes._

       (*) Fix the creation of the table of contents in the HTML version of
           the documentation.

 C.2.4 Version 2.16

       (*) Support for the `rdf' format has been discontinued and all the
           RDOFF utilities has been removed.

       (*) The `--reproducible' option now leaves the filename field in the
           COFF object format blank. This was always rather useless since
           it is only 18 characters long; as such debug formats have to
           carry their own filename information anyway.

       (*) Fix handling of MASM-syntax reserved memory (e.g. `dw ?') when
           used in structure definitions.

       (*) The preprocessor now supports functions, which can be less
           verbose and more convenient than the equivalent code implemented
           using directives. See section 5.4.

       (*) Fix the handling of `%00' in the preprocessor.

       (*) Fix incorrect handling of path names affecting error messages,
           dependency generation, and debug format output.

       (*) Support for the RDOFF output format and the RDOFF tools have
           been removed. The RDOFF tools had already been broken since at
           least NASM 2.14. For flat code the ELF output format
           recommended; for segmented code the `obj' (OMF) output format.

       (*) New facility: preprocessor functions. Preprocessor functions,
           which are expanded similarly to single-line macros, can greatly
           simplify code that in the past would have required a lengthy
           list of directives and intermediate macros. See section 5.4.

       (*) Single-line macros can now declare parameters (using a `&&'
           prefix) that creates a quoted string, but does _not_ requote an
           already quoted string. See section 5.2.1.

       (*) Instruction table updated per public information available as of
           November 2022.

       (*) All warnings in the preprocessor have now been assigned warning
           classes. See appendix A.

       (*) Fix the invalid use of `RELA'-type relocations instead of `REL'-
           type relocations when generating DWARF debug information for the
           `elf32' output format.

       (*) Fix the handling `at' in `istruc' when the structure contains
           local labels. See section 6.11.2.

       (*) When assembling with `--reproducible', don't encode the filename
           in the COFF header for the `coff', `win32' or `win64' output
           formats. The COFF header only has space for an 18-character
           filename, which makes this field rather useless in the first
           place. Debug output data, if enabled, is not affected.

       (*) Fix incorrect size calculation when using MASM syntax for non-
           byte reservations (e.g. `dw ?'.)

       (*) Allow forcing an instruction in 64-bit mode to have a (possibly
           redundant) REX prefix, using the syntax `{rex}' as a prefix.

       (*) Add a `{vex}' prefix to enforce VEX (AVX) encoding of an
           instruction, either using the 2- or 3-byte VEX prefixes.

       (*) The `CPU' directive has been augmented to allow control of
           generation of VEX (AVX) versus EVEX (AVX-512) instruction
           formats, see section 8.11.

       (*) Some recent instructions that previously have been only
           available using EVEX encodings are now also encodable using VEX
           (AVX) encodings. For backwards compatibility these encodings are
           not enabled by default, but can be generated either via an
           explicit `{vex}' prefix or by specifying either `CPU LATEVEX' or
           `CPU NOEVEX'; see section 8.11.

       (*) Document the already existing `%unimacro' directive. See section
           5.5.12.

       (*) Fix a code range generation bug in the DWARF debug format
           (incorrect information in the `DW_AT_high_pc' field) for the ELF
           output formats. This bug happened to cancel out with a bug in
           older versions of the GNU binutils linker, but breaks with other
           linkers and updated or other linkers that expect the spec to be
           followed.

       (*) Fix segment symbols with addends, e.g. `jmp _TEXT+10h:0' in
           output formats that support segment relocations, e.g. the `obj'
           format.

       (*) Fix various crashes and hangs on invalid input.

 C.2.5 Version 2.15.05

       (*) Fix `%ifid $' and `%ifid $$' incorrectly being treated as true.
           See section 5.6.7.

       (*) Add `--reproducible' option to suppress NASM version numbers and
           timestamps in output files. See section 2.1.35.

 C.2.6 Version 2.15.04

       (*) More sensible handling of the case where one single-line macro
           definition will shadow another. A warning will be issued, but
           the additional definition will be allowed. For the existing
           error case where both a parameterless and parametered macro are
           created, that warning is promoted to an error by default.

       (*) Add special preprocessor tokens `%*?' and `%*??' that expand
           like `%?' and `%??' in single-line macros only. See section
           5.2.6.

       (*) Correct the encoding of the `ENQCMDS' and `TILELOADT1'
           instructions.

       (*) Fix case where the COFF backend (the `coff', `win32' and `win64'
           output formats) would add padding bytes in the middle of a
           section if a `SECTION'/`SEGMENT' directive was provided which
           repeated an `ALIGN=' attribute. This neither matched legacy
           behavior, other backends, or user expectations.

       (*) Fix SSE instructions not being recognized with an explicit
           memory operation size (e.g. `movsd qword [eax],xmm0').

       (*) The `-L+' option no longer enables `-Lw', which is mainly useful
           to debug NASM crashes. See section 2.1.4.

       (*) Document long-standing hazards in the use of `$' in `D'_x_
           statements, see section 3.2.1.

       (*) The NASM-only RDOFF output format backend, which has been broken
           since at least NASM 2.14, has been disabled. The RDOFF tools are
           scheduled to be removed from the NASM distribution in NASM 2.16.
           If you have a concrete use case for RDOFF, please file a NASM
           bug report at `https://bugs.nasm.us/' as soon as possible.

 C.2.7 Version 2.15.03

       (*) Add instructions from the Intel Instruction Set Extensions and
           Future Features Programming Reference, June 2020. This includes
           AVX5512 `bfloat16', AVX512 mask intersect, and Intel Advanced
           Matrix Extensions (AMX).

       (*) Support for `bfloat16' floating-point constants. See section
           3.4.6 and section 7.3.

       (*) Properly display warnings in preprocess-only mode.

       (*) Fix copy-and-paste of examples from the PDF documentation.

       (*) Debug information now properly reflect the line numbers of macro
           invocations (unless declared `.nolist').

       (*) Fix excessive alignment of sections in the
           `coff'/`win32'/`win64' output formats when the user-specified
           alignment is less than the default alignment for the section or
           section type.

       (*) Fix explicit token pasting (`%+', section 5.2.4) for the cases
           where one or more parts result from empty token expansion,
           resulting in `%+' tokens at the beginning or end, or multiple
           ones in a row.

       (*) Fix macro label capture (`%00', section 5.5.7).

       (*) Much better documentation for the MASM compatibility package,
           `%use masm' (see section 7.5).

       (*) Fix `LEA' without square brackets, for MASM compatibility.

       (*) Portability fixes.

 C.2.8 Version 2.15.02

       (*) Fix miscompilation when building with `clang'.

       (*) Add `db-empty' warning class, see section 2.1.26.

       (*) Fix the dependencies in the MSVC NMAKE makefile
           (`Mkfiles/msvc.mak').

       (*) Some documentation improvements and cleanups.

       (*) Fix the handling of macro parameter ranges (`%{:}'), including
           with brace-enclosed original arguments.

 C.2.9 Version 2.15.01

       (*) Fix building the documentation from the release archive. For
           2.15, the user has to do `make warnings' manually in the main
           directory in order to be able to build the documentation, which
           means Perl needs to be installed on the system.

       (*) Add instructions for Intel Control Flow Enforcement Technology
           (CET).

C.2.10 Version 2.15

       (*) The comparison and booleanizing operators can now be used in any
           expression context, not just `%if'. See section 3.5.

       (*) New operator `?' ... `:'. See section 3.5.1.

       (*) Signed shift operators `<<<' and `>>>'. See section 3.5.9.

       (*) The MASM `DUP' syntax for data definitions is now supported, in
           a somewhat enhanced form. See section 3.2.1.

       (*) Warn for strange legacy behavior regarding empty arguments in
           multi-line macro expansion, but try to match legacy behavior in
           most cases. Legacy behavior can be disabled with the directive
           `%pragma preproc sane_empty_expansion', see section 5.5 and
           section 5.12.1.

       (*) A much more sensible limit to expression evaluation depth. The
           previously defined limit would rarely trigger before NASM died
           with a stack overrun error on most systems. See section 2.1.32.

       (*) The state of warnings can now be saved and restored via the
           `[WARNING PUSH]' and `[WARNING POP]' directives. See section
           8.14.

       (*) The `sectalign on|off' switch does not affect an explicit
           directive. See section 6.12.2.

       (*) Added `configure' option to enable building with profiling
           (`--enable-profiling').

       (*) Attempt to support of long path names, up to 32767 of UTF-16
           characters, on Windows.

       (*) Fixed 'mismatch in operand sizes' error in the `MOVDDUP',
           `CMPXCHG8B' and `CMPXCHG16B' instructions.

       (*) Improved error messages in the string transformation routine.

       (*) Removed obsolete `gnu-elf-extensions' warning about 8- and 16-
           bit relocation generation. See section 9.10.8

       (*) Added group aliases for all prefixed warnings. See section
           2.1.26.

       (*) Allowed building with MSVC versions older than 1700.

       (*) Added implicitly sized versions of the `K...' instructions,
           which allows the `K...' instructions to be specified without a
           size suffix as long as the operands are sized.

       (*) Added `-L' option for additional listing information. See
           section 2.1.4.

       (*) Added some warnings for obsolete instructions for a specified
           CPU.

       (*) Deprecated `-hf' and `-y' options. Use `-h' instead.

       (*) Made DWARF as the default debug format for ELF.

       (*) Added `%pragma list' _options..._ to set or clear listing
           options (see `opt-L').

       (*) Allowed immediate syntax for `LEA' instruction (ignore operand
           size completely).

       (*) Added limited functionality MASM compatibility package. See
           section 7.5.

       (*) Add single-line macros aliases using `%defalias' or
           `%idefalias'. These behave like a kind of "symbolic links" for
           single-line macros. See section 5.2.11 and `clear'.

       (*) Added support for stringify, nostrip, evaluating, and greedy
           single-line macro arguments. See section 5.2.1.

       (*) Unused single-line macro arguments no longer need to have a
           specified name. See section 5.2.1.

       (*) Added conditional comma operator `%,'. See section 5.2.12.

       (*) Changed private namespace from `__foo__' to `__?foo?__', so a
           user namespace starting from underscore is now clean from
           symbols. For backwards compatibility, the previous names are
           defined as aliases; see section 5.2.11, section 5.13.3 and
           chapter 6.

       (*) Added support of ELF weak symbols and external references. See
           section 9.10.5.

       (*) Changed the behavior of the EXTERN keyword and introduced
           REQUIRED keyword. See section 8.6.

       (*) Added `%ifusable' and `%ifusing' directives. See chapter 7.

       (*) Made various performance improvements and stability fixes in
           macro preprocessor engine.

       (*) Improved NASM error handling and cleaned up error messages.

       (*) Many, many bug fixes.

C.2.11 Version 2.14.03

       (*) Suppress nuisance "`label changed during code generation'"
           messages after a real error.

       (*) Add support for the `merge' and `strings' attributes on ELF
           sections. See section 9.10.2.

       (*) Add support for the `note', `preinit_array', `init_array', and
           `fini_array' sections type in ELF. See section 9.10.2.

       (*) Handle more than 32,633 sections in ELF.

C.2.12 Version 2.14.02

       (*) Fix crash due to multiple errors or warnings during the code
           generation pass if a list file is specified.

C.2.13 Version 2.14.01

       (*) Create all system-defined macros before processing command-line
           given preprocessing directives (`-p', `-d', `-u', `--pragma',
           `--before').

       (*) If debugging is enabled, define a `__DEBUG_FORMAT__' predefined
           macro. See section 6.6.

       (*) Fix an assert for the case in the `obj' format when a `SEG'
           operator refers to an `EXTERN' symbol declared further down in
           the code.

       (*) Fix a corner case in the floating-point code where a binary,
           octal or hexadecimal floating-point having at least 32, 11, or 8
           mantissa digits could produce slightly incorrect results under
           very specific conditions.

       (*) Support `-MD' without a filename, for `gcc' compatibility. `-MF'
           can be used to set the dependencies output filename. See section
           2.1.8.

       (*) Fix `-E' in combination with `-MD'. See section 2.1.22.

       (*) Fix missing errors on redefined labels; would cause convergence
           failure instead which is very slow and not easy to debug.

       (*) Duplicate definitions of the same label _with the same value_ is
           now explicitly permitted (2.14 would allow it in some
           circumstances.)

       (*) Add the option `--no-line' to ignore `%line' directives in the
           source. See section 2.1.34 and section 5.13.1.

C.2.14 Version 2.14

       (*) Changed `-I' option semantics by adding a trailing path
           separator unconditionally.

       (*) Fixed null dereference in corrupted invalid single line macros.

       (*) Fixed division by zero which may happen if source code is
           malformed.

       (*) Fixed out of bound access in processing of malformed segment
           override.

       (*) Fixed out of bound access in certain `EQU' parsing.

       (*) Fixed buffer underflow in float parsing.

       (*) Added `SGX' (Intel Software Guard Extensions) instructions.

       (*) Added `+n' syntax for multiple contiguous registers.

       (*) Fixed `subsections_via_symbols' for `macho' object format.

       (*) Added the `--gprefix', `--gpostfix', `--lprefix', and
           `--lpostfix' command line options, to allow command line base
           symbol renaming. See section 2.1.28.

       (*) Allow label renaming to be specified by `%pragma' in addition to
           from the command line. See section 8.10.

       (*) Supported generic `%pragma' namespaces, `output' and `debug'.
           See section 5.12.

       (*) Added the `--pragma' command line option to inject a `%pragma'
           directive. See section 2.1.29.

       (*) Added the `--before' command line option to accept preprocess
           statement before input. See section 2.1.30.

       (*) Added `AVX512' `VBMI2' (Additional Bit Manipulation), `VNNI'
           (Vector Neural Network), `BITALG' (Bit Algorithm), and `GFNI'
           (Galois Field New Instruction) instructions.

       (*) Added the `STATIC' directive for local symbols that should be
           renamed using global-symbol rules. See section 8.9.

       (*) Allow a symbol to be defined as `EXTERN' and then later
           overridden as `GLOBAL' or `COMMON'. Furthermore, a symbol
           declared `EXTERN' and then defined will be treated as `GLOBAL'.
           See section 8.5.

       (*) The `GLOBAL' directive no longer is required to precede the
           definition of the symbol.

       (*) Support `private_extern' as `macho' specific extension to the
           `GLOBAL' directive. See section 9.9.5.

       (*) Updated `UD0' encoding to match with the specification

       (*) Added the `--limit-X' command line option to set execution
           limits. See section 2.1.32.

       (*) Updated the `Codeview' version number to be aligned with `MASM'.

       (*) Added the `--keep-all' command line option to preserve output
           files. See section 2.1.33.

       (*) Added the `--include' command line option, an alias to `-P'
           (section 2.1.19).

       (*) Added the `--help' command line option as an alias to `-h'
           (section 3.1).

       (*) Added `-W', `-D', and `-Q' suffix aliases for `RET' instructions
           so the operand sizes of these instructions can be encoded
           without using `o16', `o32' or `o64'.

C.2.15 Version 2.13.03

       (*) Added AVX and AVX512 `VAES*' and `VPCLMULQDQ' instructions.

       (*) Fixed missing dwarf record in x32 ELF output format.

C.2.16 Version 2.13.02

       (*) Fix false positive in testing of numeric overflows.

       (*) Fix generation of `PEXTRW' instruction.

       (*) Fix `smartalign' package which could trigger an error during
           optimization if the alignment code expanded too much due to
           optimization of the previous code.

       (*) Fix a case where negative value in `TIMES' directive causes
           panic instead of an error.

       (*) Always finalize `.debug_abbrev' section with a null in `dwarf'
           output format.

       (*) Support `debug' flag in section attributes for `macho' output
           format. See section 9.9.1.

       (*) Support up to 16 characters in section names for `macho' output
           format.

       (*) Fix missing update of global `BITS' setting if `SECTION'
           directive specified a bit size using output format-specific
           extensions (e.g. `USE32' for the `obj' output format.)

       (*) Fix the incorrect generation of VEX-encoded instruction when
           static mode decorators are specified on scalar instructions,
           losing the decorators as they require EVEX encoding.

       (*) Option `-MW' to quote dependency outputs according to Watcom
           Make conventions instead of POSIX Make conventions. See section
           2.1.12.

       (*) The `obj' output format now contains embedded dependency file
           information, unless disabled with `%pragma obj nodepend'. See
           section 9.4.9.

       (*) Fix generation of dependency lists.

       (*) Fix a number of null pointer reference and memory allocation
           errors.

       (*) Always generate symbol-relative relocations for the `macho64'
           output format; at least some versions of the XCode/LLVM linker
           fails for section-relative relocations.

C.2.17 Version 2.13.01

       (*) Fix incorrect output for some types of `FAR' or `SEG' references
           in the `obj' output format, and possibly other 16-bit output
           formats.

       (*) Fix the address in the list file for an instruction containing a
           `TIMES' directive.

       (*) Fix error with `TIMES' used together with an instruction which
           can vary in size, e.g. `JMP'.

       (*) Fix breakage on some uses of the `DZ' pseudo-op.

C.2.18 Version 2.13

       (*) Support the official forms of the `UD0' and `UD1' instructions.

       (*) Allow self-segment-relative expressions in immediates and
           displacements, even when combined with an external or otherwise
           out-of-segment special symbol, e.g.:

            extern foo 
            mov eax,[foo - $ + ebx]               ; Now legal

       (*) Handle a 64-bit origin in NDISASM.

       (*) NASM can now generate sparse output files for relevant output
           formats, if the underlying operating system supports them.

       (*) The `macho' object format now supports the
           `subsections_via_symbols' and `no_dead_strip' directives, see
           section 9.9.4.

       (*) The `macho' object format now supports the `no_dead_strip',
           `live_support' and `strip_static_syms' section flags, see
           section 9.9.1.

       (*) The `macho' object format now supports the `dwarf' debugging
           format, as required by newer toolchains.

       (*) All warnings can now be suppressed if desired; warnings not
           otherwise part of any warning class are now considered its own
           warning class called `other' (e.g. `-w-other'). Furthermore,
           warning-as-error can now be controlled on a per warning class
           basis, using the syntax `-w+error='_warning-class_ and its
           equivalent for all other warning control options. See section
           2.1.26 for the command-line options and warning classes and
           section 8.14 for the `[WARNING]' directive.

       (*) Fix a number of bugs related to AVX-512 decorators.

       (*) Significant improvements to building NASM with Microsoft Visual
           Studio via `Mkfiles/msvc.mak'. It is now possible to build the
           full Windows installer binary as long as the necessary
           prerequisites are installed; see `Mkfiles/README'

       (*) To build NASM with custom modifications (table changes) or from
           the git tree now requires Perl 5.8 at the very minimum, quite
           possibly a higher version (Perl 5.24.1 tested.) There is no
           requirement to have Perl on your system at all if all you want
           to do is build unmodified NASM from source archives.

       (*) Fix the `{z}' decorator on AVX-512 `VMOVDQ*' instructions.

       (*) Add new warnings for certain dangerous constructs which never
           ought to have been allowed. In particular, the `RES'_x_ family
           of instructions should have been taking a critical expression
           all along.

       (*) Fix the EVEX (AVX-512) versions of the `VPBROADCAST', `VPEXTR',
           and `VPINSR' instructions.

       (*) Support contracted forms of additional instructions. As a
           general rule, if an instruction has a non-destructive source
           immediately after a destination register that isn't used as an
           input, NASM supports omitting that source register, using the
           destination register as that value. This among other things
           makes it easier to convert SSE code to the equivalent AVX code:

            addps xmm1,xmm0                       ; SSE instruction 
            vaddps ymm1,ymm1,ymm0                 ; AVX official long form 
            vaddps ymm1,ymm0                      ; AVX contracted form

       (*) Fix Codeview malformed compiler version record.

       (*) Add the `CLWB' and `PCOMMIT' instructions. Note that the
           `PCOMMIT' instruction has been deprecated and will never be
           included in a shipping product; it is included for completeness
           only.

       (*) Add the `%pragma' preprocessor directive for soft-error
           directives.

       (*) Add the `RDPID' instruction.

C.2.19 Version 2.12.02

       (*) Fix preprocessor errors, especially `%error' and `%warning',
           inside `%if' statements.

       (*) Fix relative relocations in 32-bit Mach-O.

       (*) More Codeview debug format fixes.

       (*) If the MASM `PTR' keyword is encountered, issue a warning. This
           is much more likely to indicate a MASM-ism encountered in NASM
           than it is a valid label. This warning can be suppressed with
           `-w-ptr', the `[warning]' directive (see section 2.1.26) or by
           the macro definition `%idefine ptr $%?' (see section 5.2.5).

       (*) When an error or a warning comes from the expansion of a multi-
           line macro, display the file and line numbers for the expanded
           macros. Macros defined with `.nolist' do not get displayed.

       (*) Add macros `ilog2fw()' and `ilog2cw()' to the `ifunc' macro
           package. See section 7.4.1.

C.2.20 Version 2.12.01

       (*) Portability fixes for some platforms.

       (*) Fix error when not specifying a list file.

       (*) Correct the handling of macro-local labels in the Codeview
           debugging format.

       (*) Add `CLZERO', `MONITORX' and `MWAITX' instructions.

C.2.21 Version 2.12

       (*) Major fixes to the `macho' backend (section 9.9); earlier
           versions would produce invalid symbols and relocations on a
           regular basis.

       (*) Support for thread-local storage in Mach-O.

       (*) Support for arbitrary sections in Mach-O.

       (*) Fix wrong negative size treated as a big positive value passed
           into backend causing NASM to crash.

       (*) Fix handling of zero-extending unsigned relocations, we have
           been printing wrong message and forgot to assign segment with
           predefined value before passing it into output format.

       (*) Fix potential write of oversized (with size greater than allowed
           in output format) relative relocations.

       (*) Portability fixes for building NASM with the LLVM compiler.

       (*) Add support of Codeview version 8 (`cv8') debug format for
           `win32' and `win64' formats in the `COFF' backend, see section
           9.6.3.

       (*) Allow 64-bit outputs in 16/32-bit only backends. Unsigned 64-bit
           relocations are zero-extended from 32-bits with a warning
           (suppressible via `-w-zext-reloc'); signed 64-bit relocations
           are an error.

       (*) Line numbers in list files now correspond to the lines in the
           source files, instead of simply being sequential.

       (*) There is now an official 64-bit (x64 a.k.a. x86-64) build for
           Windows.

C.2.22 Version 2.11.09

       (*) Fix potential stack overwrite in `macho32' backend.

       (*) Fix relocation records in `macho64' backend.

       (*) Fix symbol lookup computation in `macho64' backend.

       (*) Adjust `.symtab' and `.rela.text' sections alignments to 8 bytes
           in `elf64' backed.

       (*) Fix section length computation in `bin' backend which leaded in
           incorrect relocation records.

C.2.23 Version 2.11.08

       (*) Fix section length computation in `bin' backend which leaded in
           incorrect relocation records.

       (*) Add a warning for numeric preprocessor definitions passed via
           command line which might have unexpected results otherwise.

       (*) Add ability to specify a module name record in `rdoff' linker
           with `-mn' option.

       (*) Increase label length capacity up to 256 bytes in `rdoff'
           backend for FreePascal sake, which tends to generate very long
           labels for procedures.

       (*) Fix segmentation failure when rip addressing is used in
           `macho64' backend.

       (*) Fix access on out of memory when handling strings with a single
           grave. We have sixed similar problem in previous release but not
           all cases were covered.

       (*) Fix NULL dereference in disassembled on `BND' instruction.

C.2.24 Version 2.11.07

       (*) Fix 256 bit `VMOVNTPS' instruction.

       (*) Fix `-MD' option handling, which was rather broken in previous
           release changing command line api.

       (*) Fix access to uninitialized space when handling strings with a
           single grave.

       (*) Fix nil dereference in handling memory reference parsing.

C.2.25 Version 2.11.06

       (*) Update AVX512 instructions based on the Extension Reference
           (319433-021 Sept 2014).

       (*) Fix the behavior of `-MF' and `-MD' options (Bugzilla 3392280)

       (*) Updated Win32 Makefile to fix issue with build

C.2.26 Version 2.11.05

       (*) Add `--v' as an alias for `-v' (see section 2.1.27), for
           command-line compatibility with Yasm.

       (*) Fix a bug introduced in 2.11.03 whereby certain instructions
           would contain multiple REX prefixes, and thus be corrupt.

C.2.27 Version 2.11.04

       (*) Removed an invalid error checking code. Sometimes a memref only
           with a displacement can also set an evex flag. For example:

             vmovdqu32 [0xabcd]{k1}, zmm0

       (*) Fixed a bug in disassembler that EVEX.L'L vector length was not
           matched when EVEX.b was set because it was simply considered as
           EVEC.RC. Separated EVEX.L'L case from EVEX.RC which is ignored
           in matching.

C.2.28 Version 2.11.03

       (*) Fix a bug there REX prefixes were missing on instructions inside
           a `TIMES' statement.

C.2.29 Version 2.11.02

       (*) Add the `XSAVEC', `XSAVES' and `XRSTORS' family instructions.

       (*) Add the `CLFLUSHOPT' instruction.

C.2.30 Version 2.11.01

       (*) Allow instructions which implicitly uses `XMM0' (`VBLENDVPD',
           `VBLENDVPS', `PBLENDVB' and `SHA256RNDS2') to be specified
           without an explicit `xmm0' on the assembly line. In other words,
           the following two lines produce the same output:

            vblendvpd xmm2,xmm1,xmm0      ; Last operand is fixed xmm0 
            vblendvpd xmm2,xmm1           ; Implicit xmm0 omitted

       (*) In the ELF backends, don't crash the assembler if
           `section align' is specified without a value.

C.2.31 Version 2.11

       (*) Add support for the Intel AVX-512 instruction set:

       (*) 16 new, 512-bit SIMD registers. Total 32 `(ZMM0 ~ ZMM31)'

       (*) 8 new opmask registers `(K0 ~ K7)'. One of 7 registers
           `(K1 ~ K7)' can be used as an opmask for conditional execution.

       (*) A new EVEX encoding prefix. EVEX is based on VEX and provides
           more capabilities: opmasks, broadcasting, embedded rounding and
           compressed displacements.

        - opmask 
            VDIVPD zmm0{k1}{z}, zmm1, zmm3  ; conditional vector operation 
                                            ; using opmask k1. 
                                            ; {z} is for zero-masking 
        - broadcasting 
            VDIVPS zmm4, zmm5, [rbx]{1to16} ; load single-precision float and 
                                            ; replicate it 16 times. 32 * 16 = 512 
        - embedded rounding 
            VCVTSI2SD xmm6, xmm7, {rz-sae}, rax ; round toward zero. note that it 
                                             ; is used as if a separate operand. 
                                             ; it comes after the last SIMD operand

       (*) Add support for `ZWORD' (512 bits), `DZ' and `RESZ'.

       (*) Add support for the MPX and SHA instruction sets.

       (*) Better handling of section redefinition.

       (*) Generate manpages when running `'make dist''.

       (*) Handle all token chains in mmacro params range.

       (*) Support split [base,index] effective address:

            mov eax,[eax+8,ecx*4]   ; eax=base, ecx=index, 4=scale, 8=disp

       This is expected to be most useful for the MPX instructions.

       (*) Support `BND' prefix for branch instructions (for MPX).

       (*) The `DEFAULT' directive can now take `BND' and `NOBND' options
           to indicate whether all relevant branches should be getting
           `BND' prefixes. This is expected to be the normal for use in MPX
           code.

       (*) Add `{evex}', `{vex3}' and `{vex2}' instruction prefixes to have
           NASM encode the corresponding instruction, if possible, with an
           EVEX, 3-byte VEX, or 2-byte VEX prefix, respectively.

       (*) Support for section names longer than 8 bytes in Win32/Win64
           COFF.

       (*) The `NOSPLIT' directive by itself no longer forces a single
           register to become an index register, unless it has an explicit
           multiplier.

            mov eax,[nosplit eax]       ; eax as base register 
            mov eax,[nosplit eax*1]     ; eax as index register

C.2.32 Version 2.10.09

       (*) Pregenerate man pages.

C.2.33 Version 2.10.08

       (*) Fix `VMOVNTDQA', `MOVNTDQA' and `MOVLPD' instructions.

       (*) Fix collision for `VGATHERQPS', `VPGATHERQD' instructions.

       (*) Fix `VPMOVSXBQ', `VGATHERQPD', `VSPLLW' instructions.

       (*) Add a bunch of AMD TBM instructions.

       (*) Fix potential stack overwrite in numbers conversion.

       (*) Allow byte size in `PREFETCHTx' instructions.

       (*) Make manual pages up to date.

       (*) Make `F3' and `F2' SSE prefixes to override `66'.

       (*) Support of AMD SVM instructions in 32 bit mode.

       (*) Fix near offsets code generation for `JMP', `CALL' instrictions
           in long mode.

       (*) Fix preprocessor parse regression when id is expanding to a
           whitespace.

C.2.34 Version 2.10.07

       (*) Fix line continuation parsing being broken in previous version.

C.2.35 Version 2.10.06

       (*) Always quote the dependency source names when using the
           automatic dependency generation options.

       (*) If no dependency target name is specified via the `-MT' or `-MQ'
           options, quote the default output name.

       (*) Fix assembly of shift operations in `CPU 8086' mode.

       (*) Fix incorrect generation of explicit immediate byte for shift by
           1 under certain circumstances.

       (*) Fix assembly of the `VPCMPGTQ' instruction.

       (*) Fix RIP-relative relocations in the `macho64' backend.

C.2.36 Version 2.10.05

       (*) Add the `CLAC' and `STAC' instructions.

C.2.37 Version 2.10.04

       (*) Add back the inadvertently deleted 256-bit version of the
           `VORPD' instruction.

       (*) Correct disassembly of instructions starting with byte `82' hex.

       (*) Fix corner cases in token pasting, for example:

          %define N 1e%++%+ 5 
                  dd N, 1e+5

C.2.38 Version 2.10.03

       (*) Correct the assembly of the instruction:

       XRELEASE MOV [absolute],AL

           Previous versions would incorrectly generate `F3 A2' for this
           instruction and issue a warning; correct behavior is to emit
           `F3 88 05'.

C.2.39 Version 2.10.02

       (*) Add the `ifunc' macro package with integer functions, currently
           only integer logarithms. See section 7.4.

       (*) Add the `RDSEED', `ADCX' and `ADOX' instructions.

C.2.40 Version 2.10.01

       (*) Add missing VPMOVMSKB instruction with reg32, ymmreg operands.

C.2.41 Version 2.10

       (*) When optimization is enabled, `mov r64,imm' now optimizes to the
           shortest form possible between:

            mov r32,imm32                   ;  5 bytes 
            mov r64,imm32                   ;  7 bytes 
            mov r64,imm64                   ; 10 bytes

           To force a specific form, use the `STRICT' keyword, see section
           3.7.

       (*) Add support for the Intel AVX2 instruction set.

       (*) Add support for Bit Manipulation Instructions 1 and 2.

       (*) Add support for Intel Transactional Synchronization Extensions
           (TSX).

       (*) Add support for x32 ELF (32-bit ELF with the CPU in 64-bit
           mode.) See section 9.10.

       (*) Add support for bigendian UTF-16 and UTF-32. See section 3.4.5.

C.2.42 Version 2.09.10

       (*) Fix up NSIS script to protect uninstaller against registry keys
           absence or corruption. It brings in a few additional questions
           to a user during deinstallation procedure but still it is better
           than unpredictable file removal.

C.2.43 Version 2.09.09

       (*) Fix initialization of section attributes of `bin' output format.

       (*) Fix `mach64' output format bug that crashes NASM due to NULL
           symbols.

C.2.44 Version 2.09.08

       (*) Fix `__OUTPUT_FORMAT__' assignment when output driver alias is
           used. For example when `-f elf' is used `__OUTPUT_FORMAT__' must
           be set to `elf', if `-f elf32' is used `__OUTPUT_FORMAT__' must
           be assigned accordingly, i.e. to `elf32'. The rule applies to
           all output driver aliases. See section 6.5.

C.2.45 Version 2.09.07

       (*) Fix attempts to close same file several times when `-a' option
           is used.

       (*) Fixes for VEXTRACTF128, VMASKMOVPS encoding.

C.2.46 Version 2.09.06

       (*) Fix missed section attribute initialization in `bin' output
           target.

C.2.47 Version 2.09.05

       (*) Fix arguments encoding for VPEXTRW instruction.

       (*) Remove invalid form of VPEXTRW instruction.

       (*) Add `VLDDQU' as alias for `VLDQQU' to match specification.

C.2.48 Version 2.09.04

       (*) Fix incorrect labels offset for VEX instructions.

       (*) Eliminate bogus warning on implicit operand size override.

       (*) `%if' term could not handle 64 bit numbers.

       (*) The COFF backend was limiting relocations number to 16 bits even
           if in real there were a way more relocations.

C.2.49 Version 2.09.03

       (*) Print `%macro' name inside `%rep' blocks on error.

       (*) Fix preprocessor expansion behaviour. It happened sometime too
           early and sometime simply wrong. Move behaviour back to the
           origins (down to NASM 2.05.01).

       (*) Fix uninitialized data dereference on OMF output format.

       (*) Issue warning on unterminated `%{' construct.

       (*) Fix for documentation typo.

C.2.50 Version 2.09.02

       (*) Fix reversed tokens when `%deftok' produces more than one output
           token.

       (*) Fix segmentation fault on disassembling some VEX instructions.

       (*) Missing `%endif' did not always cause error.

           wrote them differently.

       (*) Add missing 64-bit `MOVNTI' instruction.

       (*) Fix the operand size of `VMREAD' and `VMWRITE'.

       (*) Numerous bug fixes, especially to the AES, AVX and VTX
           instructions.

       (*) The optimizer now always runs until it converges. It also runs
           even when disabled, but doesn't optimize. This allows most
           forward references to be resolved properly.

       (*) `%push' no longer needs a context identifier; omitting the
           context identifier results in an anonymous context.

       (*) `%?' and `%??' to refer to the name of a macro itself. In
           particular, `%idefine keyword $%?' can be used to make a keyword
           "disappear".

       (*) New options for dependency generation: `-MD', `-MF', `-MP',
           `-MT', `-MQ'.

       (*) New preprocessor directives `%pathsearch' and `%depend'; INCBIN
           reimplemented as a macro.

       (*) `%include' now resolves macros in a sane manner.

       (*) `%substr' can now be used to get other than one-character

       (*) Fix segfaults due to memory overwrites when floating-point
           constants were used.

       (*) Fix segfaults due to missing include files.

       (*) Fix OpenWatcom Makefiles for DOS and OS/2.

           been defined.

       (*) ELF: Experimental support for DWARF debugging information.

       (*) New compile date and time standard macros.

       (*) `%ifnum' now returns true for negative numbers.

           actually will suppress debugging output when `-g' not specified.

 C.3.3 Version 0.98.37

       (*) Paths given in `-I' switch searched for `incbin'-ed as well as
           `%include'-ed files.

       (*) New standard macros __NASM_SUBMINOR__ and __NASM_VER__ macros.

       (*) Lots of Makefile updates and bug fixes.

       (*) New `%ifmacro' directive to test for multiline macros.

       (*) Documentation updates.

       (*) Fixes for 16-bit OBJ format output.

       (*) Changed the NASM environment variable to NASMENV.

C.3.10 Version 0.98.30

       (*) Changed doc files a lot: completely removed old READMExx and
           Wishlist files, incorporating all information in CHANGES and
           TODO.

       (*) I waited a long time to rename zoutieee.c to (original)
           outieee.c

       (*) 16-bit support for ELF output format (GNU extension, but
           useful.)

C.3.11 Version 0.98.28

       (*) Fastcooked this for Debian's Woody release: Frank applied the
           INCBIN bug patch to 0.98.25alt and called it 0.98.28 to not
           confuse poor little apt-get.

C.3.33 Version 0.98.09b with John Coffman patches released 28-Oct-2001

       Changes from 0.98.07 release to 98.09b as of 28-Oct-2001

       (*) More closely compatible with 0.98 when -O0 is implied or
           specified. Not strictly identical, since backward branches in
           range of short offsets are recognized, and signed byte values
           with no explicit size specification will be assembled as a
           single byte.

       (*) More forgiving with the PUSH instruction. 0.98 requires a size
           to be specified always. 0.98.09b will imply the size from the
           current BITS setting (16 or 32).

       (*) Changed definition of the optimization flag:

          -O0     strict two-pass assembly, JMP and Jcc are 
                  handled more like 0.98, except that back- 
                  ward JMPs are short, if possible. 
       
          -O1     strict two-pass assembly, but forward 
                  branches are assembled with code guaranteed 
                  to reach; may produce larger code than 
                  -O0, but will produce successful assembly 
                  more often if branch offset sizes are not 
                  specified. 
       
          -O2     multi-pass optimization, minimize branch 
                  offsets; also will minimize signed immed- 
                  iate bytes, overriding size specification. 
       
          -O3     like -O2, but more passes taken, if needed

C.3.34 Version 0.98.07 released 01/28/01

       (*) Added Stepane Denis' SSE2 instructions to a *working* version of
           the code - some earlier versions were based on broken code -
           sorry 'bout that. version "0.98.07"

       (*) Cosmetic modifications to nasm.c, nasm.h, AUTHORS, MODIFIED

C.3.35 Version 0.98.06f released 01/18/01

       (*) Add "metalbrain"s jecxz bug fix in insns.dat

       (*) Alter nasmdoc.src to match - version "0.98.06f"

C.3.36 Version 0.98.06e released 01/09/01

       (*) Removed the "outforms.h" file - it appears to be someone's old
           backup of "outform.h". version "0.98.06e"

       (*) fbk - finally added the fix for the "multiple %includes bug",
           known since 7/27/99 - reported originally (?) and sent to us by
           Austin Lunnen - he reports that John Fine had a fix within the
           day. Here it is...

       (*) Nelson Rush resigns from the group. Big thanks to Nelson for his
           leadership and enthusiasm in getting these changes incorporated
           into Nasm!

       (*) fbk - [list +], [list -] directives - ineptly implemented,
           should be re-written or removed, perhaps.

       (*) Brian Raiter / fbk - "elfso bug" fix - applied to aoutb format
           as well - testing might be desirable...

       (*) James Seter - -postfix, -prefix command line switches.

       (*) Yuri Zaporozhets - rdoff utility changes.

C.3.37 Version 0.98p1

       (*) GAS-like palign (Panos Minos)

       (*) FIXME: Someone, fill this in with details

C.3.38 Version 0.98bf (bug-fixed)

       (*) Fixed - elf and aoutb bug - shared libraries - multiple
           "%include" bug in "-f obj" - jcxz, jecxz bug - unrecognized
           option bug in ndisasm

C.3.39 Version 0.98.03 with John Coffman's changes released 27-Jul-2000

       (*) Added signed byte optimizations for the 0x81/0x83 class of
           instructions: ADC, ADD, AND, CMP, OR, SBB, SUB, XOR: when used
           as 'ADD reg16,imm' or 'ADD reg32,imm.' Also optimization of
           signed byte form of 'PUSH imm' and 'IMUL reg,imm'/'IMUL
           reg,reg,imm.' No size specification is needed.

       (*) Added multi-pass JMP and Jcc offset optimization. Offsets on
           forward references will preferentially use the short form,
           without the need to code a specific size (short or near) for the
           branch. Added instructions for 'Jcc label' to use the form
           'Jnotcc $+3/JMP label', in cases where a short offset is out of
           bounds. If compiling for a 386 or higher CPU, then the 386 form
           of Jcc will be used instead.

           This feature is controlled by a new command-line switch: "O",
           (upper case letter O). "-O0" reverts the assembler to no extra
           optimization passes, "-O1" allows up to 5 extra passes, and "-
           O2"(default), allows up to 10 extra optimization passes.

       (*) Added a new directive: 'cpu XXX', where XXX is any of: 8086,
           186, 286, 386, 486, 586, pentium, 686, PPro, P2, P3 or Katmai.
           All are case insensitive. All instructions will be selected only
           if they apply to the selected cpu or lower. Corrected a couple
           of bugs in cpu-dependence in 'insns.dat'.

       (*) Added to 'standard.mac', the "use16" and "use32" forms of the
           "bits 16/32" directive. This is nothing new, just conforms to a
           lot of other assemblers. (minor)

       (*) Changed label allocation from 320/32 (10000 labels @ 200K+) to
           32/37 (1000 labels); makes running under DOS much easier. Since
           additional label space is allocated dynamically, this should
           have no effect on large programs with lots of labels. The 37 is
           a prime, believed to be better for hashing. (minor)

C.3.40 Version 0.98.03

       "Integrated patchfile 0.98-0.98.01. I call this version 0.98.03 for
       historical reasons: 0.98.02 was trashed." --John Coffman
       <johninsd@san.rr.com>, 27-Jul-2000

       (*) Kendall Bennett's SciTech MGL changes

       (*) Note that you must define "TASM_COMPAT" at compile-time to get
           the Tasm Ideal Mode compatibility.

       (*) All changes can be compiled in and out using the TASM_COMPAT
           macros, and when compiled without TASM_COMPAT defined we get the
           exact same binary as the unmodified 0.98 sources.

       (*) standard.mac, macros.c: Added macros to ignore TASM directives
           before first include

       (*) nasm.h: Added extern declaration for tasm_compatible_mode

       (*) nasm.c: Added global variable tasm_compatible_mode

       (*) Added command line switch for TASM compatible mode (-t)

       (*) Changed version command line to reflect when compiled with TASM
           additions

       (*) Added response file processing to allow all arguments on a
           single line (response file is @resp rather than -@resp for NASM
           format).

       (*) labels.c: Changes islocal() macro to support TASM style @@local
           labels.

       (*) Added islocalchar() macro to support TASM style @@local labels.

       (*) parser.c: Added support for TASM style memory references (ie:
           mov [DWORD eax],10 rather than the NASM style mov DWORD
           [eax],10).

       (*) preproc.c: Added new directives, `%arg', `%local', `%stacksize'
           to directives table

       (*) Added support for TASM style directives without a leading %
           symbol.

       (*) Integrated a block of changes from Andrew Zabolotny
           <bit@eltech.ru>:

       (*) A new keyword `%xdefine' and its case-insensitive counterpart
           `%ixdefine'. They work almost the same way as `%define' and
           `%idefine' but expand the definition immediately, not on the
           invocation. Something like a cross between `%define' and
           `%assign'. The "x" suffix stands for "eXpand", so "xdefine" can
           be deciphered as "expand-and-define". Thus you can do things
           like this:

            %assign ofs     0 
       
            %macro  arg     1 
                    %xdefine %1 dword [esp+ofs] 
                    %assign ofs ofs+4 
            %endmacro

       (*) Changed the place where the expansion of %$name macros are
           expanded. Now they are converted into ..@ctxnum.name form when
           detokenizing, so there are no quirks as before when using %$name
           arguments to macros, in macros etc. For example:

            %macro  abc     1 
                    %define %1 hello 
            %endm 
       
            abc     %$here 
            %$here

           Now last line will be expanded into "hello" as expected. This
           also allows for lots of goodies, a good example are extended
           "proc" macros included in this archive.

       (*) Added a check for "cstk" in smacro_defined() before calling
           get_ctx() - this allows for things like:

            %ifdef %$abc 
            %endif

           to work without warnings even in no context.

       (*) Added a check for "cstk" in %if*ctx and %elif*ctx directives -
           this allows to use `%ifctx' without excessive warnings. If there
           is no active context, `%ifctx' goes through "false" branch.

       (*) Removed "user error: " prefix with `%error' directive: it just
           clobbers the output and has absolutely no functionality.
           Besides, this allows to write macros that does not differ from
           built-in functions in any way.

       (*) Added expansion of string that is output by `%error' directive.
           Now you can do things like:

            %define hello(x) Hello, x! 
       
            %define %$name andy 
            %error "hello(%$name)"

           Same happened with `%include' directive.

       (*) Now all directives that expect an identifier will try to expand
           and concatenate everything without whitespaces in between before
           usage. For example, with "unfixed" nasm the commands

            %define %$abc hello 
            %define __%$abc goodbye 
            __%$abc

           would produce "incorrect" output: last line will expand to

            hello goodbyehello

           Not quite what you expected, eh? :-) The answer is that
           preprocessor treats the `%define' construct as if it would be

            %define __ %$abc goodbye

           (note the white space between __ and %$abc). After my "fix" it
           will "correctly" expand into

            goodbye

           as expected. Note that I use quotes around words "correct",
           "incorrect" etc because this is rather a feature not a bug;
           however current behaviour is more logical (and allows more
           advanced macro usage :-).

       Same change was applied to:
       `%push',`%macro',`%imacro',`%define',`%idefine',`%xdefine',`%ixdefine',
       `%assign',`%iassign',`%undef'

       (*) A new directive [WARNING {+|-}warning-id] have been added. It
           works only if the assembly phase is enabled (i.e. it doesn't
           work with nasm -e).

       (*) A new warning type: macro-selfref. By default this warning is
           disabled; when enabled NASM warns when a macro self-references
           itself; for example the following source:

              [WARNING macro-selfref] 
       
              %macro          push    1-* 
                      %rep    %0 
                              push    %1 
                              %rotate 1 
                      %endrep 
              %endmacro 
       
                              push    eax,ebx,ecx

           will produce a warning, but if we remove the first line we won't
           see it anymore (which is The Right Thing To Do {tm} IMHO since C
           preprocessor eats such constructs without warnings at all).

       (*) Added a "error" routine to preprocessor which always will set
           ERR_PASS1 bit in severity_code. This removes annoying repeated
           errors on first and second passes from preprocessor.

       (*) Added the %+ operator in single-line macros for concatenating
           two identifiers. Usage example:

              %define _myfunc _otherfunc 
              %define cextern(x) _ %+ x 
              cextern (myfunc)

           After first expansion, third line will become "_myfunc". After
           this expansion is performed again so it becomes "_otherunc".

       (*) Now if preprocessor is in a non-emitting state, no warning or
           error will be emitted. Example:

              %if 1 
                      mov     eax,ebx 
              %else 
                      put anything you want between these two brackets, 
                      even macro-parameter references %1 or local 
                      labels %$zz or macro-local labels %%zz - no 
                      warning will be emitted. 
              %endif

       (*) Context-local variables on expansion as a last resort are looked
           up in outer contexts. For example, the following piece:

              %push   outer 
              %define %$a [esp] 
       
                      %push   inner 
                      %$a 
                      %pop 
              %pop

           will expand correctly the fourth line to [esp]; if we'll define
           another %$a inside the "inner" context, it will take precedence
           over outer definition. However, this modification has been
           applied only to expand_smacro and not to smacro_define: as a
           consequence expansion looks in outer contexts, but `%ifdef'
           won't look in outer contexts.

           This behaviour is needed because we don't want nested contexts
           to act on already defined local macros. Example:

              %define %$arg1  [esp+4] 
              test    eax,eax 
              if      nz 
                      mov     eax,%$arg1 
              endif

           In this example the "if" mmacro enters into the "if" context, so
           %$arg1 is not valid anymore inside "if". Of course it could be
           worked around by using explicitly %$$arg1 but this is ugly IMHO.

       (*) Fixed memory leak in `%undef'. The origline wasn't freed before
           exiting on success.

       (*) Fixed trap in preprocessor when line expanded to empty set of
           tokens. This happens, for example, in the following case:

              #define SOMETHING 
              SOMETHING

C.3.41 Version 0.98

       All changes since NASM 0.98p3 have been produced by H. Peter Anvin
       <hpa@zytor.com>.

       (*) The documentation comment delimiter is

       (*) Allow EQU definitions to refer to external labels; reported by
           Pedro Gimeno.

       (*) Re-enable support for RDOFF v1; reported by Pedro Gimeno.

       (*) Updated License file per OK from Simon and Julian.

C.3.42 Version 0.98p9

       (*) Update documentation (although the instruction set reference
           will have to wait; I don't want to hold up the 0.98 release for
           it.)

       (*) Verified that the NASM implementation of the PEXTRW and PMOVMSKB
           instructions is correct. The encoding differs from what the
           Intel manuals document, but the Pentium III behaviour matches
           NASM, not the Intel manuals.

       (*) Fix handling of implicit sizes in PSHUFW and PINSRW, reported by
           Stefan Hoffmeister.

       (*) Resurrect the -s option, which was removed when changing the
           diagnostic output to stdout.

C.3.43 Version 0.98p8

       (*) Fix for "DB" when NASM is running on a bigendian machine.

       (*) Invoke insns.pl once for each output script, making Makefile.in
           legal for "make -j".

       (*) Improve the Unix configure-based makefiles to make package
           creation easier.

       (*) Included an RPM .spec file for building RPM (RedHat Package
           Manager) packages on Linux or Unix systems.

       (*) Fix Makefile dependency problems.

       (*) Change src/rdsrc.pl to include sectioning information in info
           output; required for install-info to work.

       (*) Updated the RDOFF distribution to version 2 from Jules; minor
           massaging to make it compile in my environment.

       (*) Split doc files that can be built by anyone with a Perl
           interpreter off into a separate archive.

       (*) "Dress rehearsal" release!

C.3.44 Version 0.98p7

       (*) Fixed opcodes with a third byte-sized immediate argument to not
           complain if given "byte" on the immediate.

       (*) Allow `%undef' to remove single-line macros with arguments. This
           matches the behaviour of #undef in the C preprocessor.

       (*) Allow -d, -u, -i and -p to be specified as -D, -U, -I and -P for
           compatibility with most C compilers and preprocessors. This
           allows Makefile options to be shared between cc and nasm, for
           example.

       (*) Minor cleanups.

       (*) Went through the list of Katmai instructions and hopefully fixed
           the (rather few) mistakes in it.

       (*) (Hopefully) fixed a number of disassembler bugs related to
           ambiguous instructions (disambiguated by -p) and SSE
           instructions with REP.

       (*) Fix for bug reported by Mark Junger: "call dword 0x12345678"
           should work and may add an OSP (affected CALL, JMP, Jcc).

       (*) Fix for environments when "stderr" isn't a compile-time
           constant.

C.3.45 Version 0.98p6

       (*) Took officially over coordination of the 0.98 release; so drop
           the p3.x notation. Skipped p4 and p5 to avoid confusion with
           John Fine's J4 and J5 releases.

       (*) Update the documentation; however, it still doesn't include
           documentation for the various new instructions. I somehow wonder
           if it makes sense to have an instruction set reference in the
           assembler manual when Intel et al have PDF versions of their
           manuals online.

       (*) Recognize "idt" or "centaur" for the -p option to ndisasm.

       (*) Changed error messages back to stderr where they belong, but add
           an -E option to redirect them elsewhere (the DOS shell cannot
           redirect stderr.)

       (*) -M option to generate Makefile dependencies (based on code from
           Alex Verstak.)

       (*) `%undef' preprocessor directive, and -u option, that undefines a
           single-line macro.

       (*) OS/2 Makefile (Mkfiles/Makefile.os2) for Borland under OS/2;
           from Chuck Crayne.

       (*) Various minor bugfixes (reported by): - Dangling `%s' in
           preproc.c (Martin Junker)

       (*) THERE ARE KNOWN BUGS IN SSE AND THE OTHER KATMAI INSTRUCTIONS. I
           am on a trip and didn't bring the Katmai instruction reference,
           so I can't work on them right now.

       (*) Updated the License file per agreement with Simon and Jules to
           include a GPL distribution clause.

C.3.46 Version 0.98p3.7

       (*) (Hopefully) fixed the canned Makefiles to include the outrdf2
           and zoutieee modules.

       (*) Renamed changes.asm to changed.asm.

C.3.47 Version 0.98p3.6

       (*) Fixed a bunch of instructions that were added in 0.98p3.5 which
           had memory operands, and the address-size prefix was missing
           from the instruction pattern.

C.3.48 Version 0.98p3.5

       (*) Merged in changes from John S. Fine's 0.98-J5 release. John's
           based 0.98-J5 on my 0.98p3.3 release; this merges the changes.

       (*) Expanded the instructions flag field to a long so we can fit
           more flags; mark SSE (KNI) and AMD or Katmai-specific
           instructions as such.

       (*) Fix the "PRIV" flag on a bunch of instructions, and create new
           "PROT" flag for protected-mode-only instructions (orthogonal to
           if the instruction is privileged!) and new "SMM" flag for SMM-
           only instructions.

       (*) Added AMD-only SYSCALL and SYSRET instructions.

       (*) Make SSE actually work, and add new Katmai MMX instructions.

       (*) Added a -p (preferred vendor) option to ndisasm so that it can
           distinguish e.g. Cyrix opcodes also used in SSE. For example:

            ndisasm -p cyrix aliased.bin 
            00000000  670F514310        paddsiw mm0,[ebx+0x10] 
            00000005  670F514320        paddsiw mm0,[ebx+0x20] 
            ndisasm -p intel aliased.bin 
            00000000  670F514310        sqrtps xmm0,[ebx+0x10] 
            00000005  670F514320        sqrtps xmm0,[ebx+0x20]

       (*) Added a bunch of Cyrix-specific instructions.

C.3.49 Version 0.98p3.4

       (*) Made at least an attempt to modify all the additional Makefiles
           (in the Mkfiles directory). I can't test it, but this was the
           best I could do.

       (*) DOS DJGPP+"Opus Make" Makefile from John S. Fine.

       (*) changes.asm changes from John S. Fine.

C.3.50 Version 0.98p3.3

       (*) Patch from Conan Brink to allow nesting of `%rep' directives.

       (*) If we're going to allow INT01 as an alias for INT1/ICEBP (one of
           Jules 0.98p3 changes), then we should allow INT03 as an alias
           for INT3 as well.

       (*) Updated changes.asm to include the latest changes.

       (*) Tried to clean up the <CR>s that had snuck in from a DOS/Windows
           environment into my Unix environment, and try to make sure than
           DOS/Windows users get them back.

       (*) We would silently generate broken tools if insns.dat wasn't
           sorted properly. Change insns.pl so that the order doesn't
           matter.

       (*) Fix bug in insns.pl (introduced by me) which would cause
           conditional instructions to have an extra "cc" in disassembly,
           e.g. "jnz" disassembled as "jccnz".

C.3.51 Version 0.98p3.2

       (*) Merged in John S. Fine's changes from his 0.98-J4 prerelease;
           see http://www.csoft.net/cz/johnfine/

       (*) Changed previous "spotless" Makefile target (appropriate for
           distribution) to "distclean", and added "cleaner" target which
           is same as "clean" except deletes files generated by Perl
           scripts; "spotless" is union.

       (*) Removed BASIC programs from distribution. Get a Perl interpreter
           instead (see below.)

       (*) Calling this "pre-release 3.2" rather than "p3-hpa2" because of
           John's contributions.

       (*) Actually link in the IEEE output format (zoutieee.c); fix a
           bunch of compiler warnings in that file. Note I don't know what
           IEEE output is supposed to look like, so these changes were made
           "blind".

C.3.52 Version 0.98p3-hpa

       (*) Merged nasm098p3.zip with nasm-0.97.tar.gz to create a fully
           buildable version for Unix systems (Makefile.in updates, etc.)

       (*) Changed insns.pl to create the instruction tables in nasm.h and
           names.c, so that a new instruction can be added by adding it
           *only* to insns.dat.

       (*) Added the following new instructions: SYSENTER, SYSEXIT, FXSAVE,
           FXRSTOR, UD1, UD2 (the latter two are two opcodes that Intel
           guarantee will never be used; one of them is documented as UD2
           in Intel documentation, the other one just as "Undefined Opcode"
           -- calling it UD1 seemed to make sense.)

       (*) MAX_SYMBOL was defined to be 9, but LOADALL286 and LOADALL386
           are 10 characters long. Now MAX_SYMBOL is derived from
           insns.dat.

       (*) A note on the BASIC programs included: forget them. insns.bas is
           already out of date. Get yourself a Perl interpreter for your
           platform of choice at http://www.cpan.org/ports/index.html.

C.3.53 Version 0.98 pre-release 3

       (*) added response file support, improved command line handling, new
           layout help screen

       (*) fixed limit checking bug, 'OUT byte nn, reg' bug, and a couple
           of rdoff related bugs, updated Wishlist; 0.98 Prerelease 3.

C.3.54 Version 0.98 pre-release 2

       (*) fixed bug in outcoff.c to do with truncating section names
           longer than 8 characters, referencing beyond end of string; 0.98
           pre-release 2

C.3.55 Version 0.98 pre-release 1

       (*) Fixed a bug whereby STRUC didn't work at all in RDF.

       (*) Fixed a problem with group specification in PUBDEFs in OBJ.

       (*) Improved ease of adding new output formats. Contribution due to
           Fox Cutter.

       (*) Fixed a bug in relocations in the `bin' format: was showing up
           when a relocatable reference crossed an 8192-byte boundary in
           any output section.

       (*) Fixed a bug in local labels: local-label lookups were
           inconsistent between passes one and two if an EQU occurred
           between the definition of a global label and the subsequent use
           of a local label local to that global.

       (*) Fixed a seg-fault in the preprocessor (again) which happened
           when you use a blank line as the first line of a multi-line
           macro definition and then defined a label on the same line as a
           call to that macro.

       (*) Fixed a stale-pointer bug in the handling of the NASM
           environment variable. Thanks to Thomas McWilliams.

       (*) ELF had a hard limit on the number of sections which caused
           segfaults when transgressed. Fixed.

       (*) Added ability for ndisasm to read from stdin by using `-' as the
           filename.

       (*) ndisasm wasn't outputting the TO keyword. Fixed.

       (*) Fixed error cascade on bogus expression in `%if' - an error in
           evaluation was causing the entire `%if' to be discarded, thus
           creating trouble later when the `%else' or `%endif' was
           encountered.

       (*) Forward reference tracking was instruction-granular not operand-
           granular, which was causing 286-specific code to be generated
           needlessly on code of the form `shr word [forwardref],1'. Thanks
           to Jim Hague for sending a patch.

       (*) All messages now appear on stdout, as sending them to stderr
           serves no useful purpose other than to make redirection
           difficult.

       (*) Fixed the problem with EQUs pointing to an external symbol -
           this now generates an error message.

       (*) Allowed multiple size prefixes to an operand, of which only the
           first is taken into account.

       (*) Incorporated John Fine's changes, including fixes of a large
           number of preprocessor bugs, some small problems in OBJ, and a
           reworking of label handling to define labels before their line
           is assembled, rather than after.

       (*) Reformatted a lot of the source code to be more readable.
           Included 'coding.txt' as a guideline for how to format code for
           contributors.

       (*) Stopped nested `%reps' causing a panic - they now cause a
           slightly more friendly error message instead.

       (*) Fixed floating point constant problems (patch by Pedro Gimeno)

       (*) Fixed the return value of insn_size() not being checked for -1,
           indicating an error.

       (*) Incorporated 3Dnow! instructions.

       (*) Fixed the 'mov eax, eax + ebx' bug.

       (*) Fixed the GLOBAL EQU bug in ELF. Released developers release 3.

       (*) Incorporated John Fine's command line parsing changes

       (*) Incorporated David Lindauer's OMF debug support

       (*) Made changes for LCC 4.0 support (`__NASM_CDecl__', removed
           register size specification warning when sizes agree).

   C.4 NASM 0.90-0.97

       Revisions before 0.98.

 C.4.1 Version 0.97 released December 1997

       (*) This was entirely a bug-fix release to 0.96, which seems to have
           got cursed. Silly me.

       (*) Fixed stupid mistake in OBJ which caused `MOV EAX,<constant>' to
           fail. Caused by an error in the `MOV EAX,<segment>' support.

       (*) ndisasm hung at EOF when compiled with lcc on Linux because lcc
           on Linux somehow breaks feof(). ndisasm now does not rely on
           feof().

       (*) A heading in the documentation was missing due to a markup error
           in the indexing. Fixed.

       (*) Fixed failure to update all pointers on realloc() within
           extended- operand code in parser.c. Was causing wrong behaviour
           and seg faults on lines such as `dd 0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,...'

       (*) Fixed a subtle preprocessor bug whereby invoking one multi-line
           macro on the first line of the expansion of another, when the
           second had been invoked with a label defined before it, didn't
           expand the inner macro.

       (*) Added internal.doc back in to the distribution archives - it was
           missing in 0.96 *blush*

       (*) Fixed bug causing 0.96 to be unable to assemble its own test
           files, specifically objtest.asm. *blush again*

       (*) Fixed seg-faults and bogus error messages caused by mismatching
           `%rep' and `%endrep' within multi-line macro definitions.

       (*) Fixed a problem with buffer overrun in OBJ, which was causing
           corruption at ends of long PUBDEF records.

       (*) Separated DOS archives into main-program and documentation to
           reduce download size.

 C.4.2 Version 0.96 released November 1997

       (*) Fixed a bug whereby, if `nasm sourcefile' would cause a filename
           collision warning and put output into `nasm.out', then `nasm
           sourcefile -o outputfile' still gave the warning even though the
           `-o' was honoured. Fixed name pollution under Digital UNIX: one
           of its header files defined R_SP, which broke the enum in
           nasm.h.

       (*) Fixed minor instruction table problems: FUCOM and FUCOMP didn't
           have two-operand forms; NDISASM didn't recognise the longer
           register forms of PUSH and POP (eg FF F3 for PUSH BX); TEST
           mem,imm32 was flagged as undocumented; the 32-bit forms of CMOV
           had 16-bit operand size prefixes; `AAD imm' and `AAM imm' are no
           longer flagged as undocumented because the Intel Architecture
           reference documents them.

       (*) Fixed a problem with the local-label mechanism, whereby strange
           types of symbol (EQUs, auto-defined OBJ segment base symbols)
           interfered with the `previous global label' value and screwed up
           local labels.

       (*) Fixed a bug whereby the stub preprocessor didn't communicate
           with the listing file generator, so that the -a and -l options
           in conjunction would produce a useless listing file.

       (*) Merged `os2' object file format back into `obj', after
           discovering that `obj' _also_ shouldn't have a link pass
           separator in a module containing a non-trivial MODEND. Flat
           segments are now declared using the FLAT attribute. `os2' is no
           longer a valid object format name: use `obj'.

       (*) Removed the fixed-size temporary storage in the evaluator. Very
           very long expressions (like `mov ax,1+1+1+1+...' for two hundred
           1s or so) should now no longer crash NASM.

       (*) Fixed a bug involving segfaults on disassembly of MMX
           instructions, by changing the meaning of one of the operand-type
           flags in nasm.h. This may cause other apparently unrelated MMX
           problems; it needs to be tested thoroughly.

       (*) Fixed some buffer overrun problems with large OBJ output files.
           Thanks to DJ Delorie for the bug report and fix.

       (*) Made preprocess-only mode actually listen to the `%line' markers
           as it prints them, so that it can report errors more sanely.

       (*) Re-designed the evaluator to keep more sensible track of
           expressions involving forward references: can now cope with
           previously-nightmare situations such as:

         mov ax,foo | bar 
         foo equ 1 
         bar equ 2

       (*) Added the ALIGN and ALIGNB standard macros.

       (*) Added PIC support in ELF: use of WRT to obtain the four extra
           relocation types needed.

       (*) Added the ability for output file formats to define their own
           extensions to the GLOBAL, COMMON and EXTERN directives.

       (*) Implemented common-variable alignment, and global-symbol type
           and size declarations, in ELF.

       (*) Implemented NEAR and FAR keywords for common variables, plus
           far-common element size specification, in OBJ.

       (*) Added a feature whereby EXTERNs and COMMONs in OBJ can be given
           a default WRT specification (either a segment or a group).

       (*) Transformed the Unix NASM archive into an auto-configuring
           package.

       (*) Added a sanity-check for people applying SEG to things which are
           already segment bases: this previously went unnoticed by the SEG
           processing and caused OBJ-driver panics later.

       (*) Added the ability, in OBJ format, to deal with `MOV
           EAX,<segment>' type references: OBJ doesn't directly support
           dword-size segment base fixups, but as long as the low two bytes
           of the constant term are zero, a word-size fixup can be
           generated instead and it will work.

       (*) Added the ability to specify sections' alignment requirements in
           Win32 object files and pure binary files.

       (*) Added preprocess-time expression evaluation: the `%assign' (and
           `%iassign') directive and the bare `%if' (and `%elif')
           conditional. Added relational operators to the evaluator, for
           use only in `%if' constructs: the standard relationals = < > <=
           >= <> (and C-like synonyms == and !=) plus low-precedence
           logical operators &&, ^^ and ||.

       (*) Added a preprocessor repeat construct: `%rep' / `%exitrep' /
           `%endrep'.

       (*) Added the __FILE__ and __LINE__ standard macros.

       (*) Added a sanity check for number constants being greater than
           0xFFFFFFFF. The warning can be disabled.

       (*) Added the %0 token whereby a variadic multi-line macro can tell
           how many parameters it's been given in a specific invocation.

       (*) Added `%rotate', allowing multi-line macro parameters to be
           cycled.

       (*) Added the `*' option for the maximum parameter count on multi-
           line macros, allowing them to take arbitrarily many parameters.

       (*) Added the ability for the user-level forms of EXTERN, GLOBAL and
           COMMON to take more than one argument.

       (*) Added the IMPORT and EXPORT directives in OBJ format, to deal
           with Windows DLLs.

       (*) Added some more preprocessor `%if' constructs: `%ifidn' /
           `%ifidni' (exact textual identity), and `%ifid' / `%ifnum' /
           `%ifstr' (token type testing).

       (*) Added the ability to distinguish SHL AX,1 (the 8086 version)
           from SHL AX,BYTE 1 (the 286-and-upwards version whose constant
           happens to be 1).

       (*) Added NetBSD/FreeBSD/OpenBSD's variant of a.out format, complete
           with PIC shared library features.

       (*) Changed NASM's idiosyncratic handling of FCLEX, FDISI, FENI,
           FINIT, FSAVE, FSTCW, FSTENV, and FSTSW to bring it into line
           with the otherwise accepted standard. The previous behaviour,
           though it was a deliberate feature, was a deliberate feature
           based on a misunderstanding. Apologies for the inconvenience.

       (*) Improved the flexibility of ABSOLUTE: you can now give it an
           expression rather than being restricted to a constant, and it
           can take relocatable arguments as well.

       (*) Added the ability for a variable to be declared as EXTERN
           multiple times, and the subsequent definitions are just ignored.

       (*) We now allow instruction prefixes (CS, DS, LOCK, REPZ etc) to be
           alone on a line (without a following instruction).

       (*) Improved sanity checks on whether the arguments to EXTERN,
           GLOBAL and COMMON are valid identifiers.

       (*) Added misc/exebin.mac to allow direct generation of .EXE files
           by hacking up an EXE header using DB and DW; also added
           test/binexe.asm to demonstrate the use of this. Thanks to Yann
           Guidon for contributing the EXE header code.

       (*) ndisasm forgot to check whether the input file had been
           successfully opened. Now it does. Doh!

       (*) Added the Cyrix extensions to the MMX instruction set.

       (*) Added a hinting mechanism to allow [EAX+EBX] and [EBX+EAX] to be
           assembled differently. This is important since [ESI+EBP] and
           [EBP+ESI] have different default base segment registers.

       (*) Added support for the PharLap OMF extension for 4096-byte
           segment alignment.

 C.4.3 Version 0.95 released July 1997

       (*) Fixed yet another ELF bug. This one manifested if the user
           relied on the default segment, and attempted to define global
           symbols without first explicitly declaring the target segment.

       (*) Added makefiles (for NASM and the RDF tools) to build Win32
           console apps under Symantec C++. Donated by Mark Junker.

       (*) Added `macros.bas' and `insns.bas', QBasic versions of the Perl
           scripts that convert `standard.mac' to `macros.c' and convert
           `insns.dat' to `insnsa.c' and `insnsd.c'. Also thanks to Mark
           Junker.

       (*) Changed the diassembled forms of the conditional instructions so
           that JB is now emitted as JC, and other similar changes.
           Suggested list by Ulrich Doewich.

       (*) Added `@' to the list of valid characters to begin an identifier
           with.

       (*) Documentary changes, notably the addition of the `Common
           Problems' section in nasm.doc.

       (*) Fixed a bug relating to 32-bit PC-relative fixups in OBJ.

       (*) Fixed a bug in perm_copy() in labels.c which was causing
           exceptions in cleanup_labels() on some systems.

       (*) Positivity sanity check in TIMES argument changed from a warning
           to an error following a further complaint.

       (*) Changed the acceptable limits on byte and word operands to allow
           things like `~10111001b' to work.

       (*) Fixed a major problem in the preprocessor which caused seg-
           faults if macro definitions contained blank lines or comment-
           only lines.

       (*) Fixed inadequate error checking on the commas separating the
           arguments to `db', `dw' etc.

       (*) Fixed a crippling bug in the handling of macros with operand
           counts defined with a `+' modifier.

       (*) Fixed a bug whereby object file formats which stored the input
           file name in the output file (such as OBJ and COFF) weren't
           doing so correctly when the output file name was specified on
           the command line.

       (*) Removed [INC] and [INCLUDE] support for good, since they were
           obsolete anyway.

       (*) Fixed a bug in OBJ which caused all fixups to be output in 16-
           bit (old-format) FIXUPP records, rather than putting the 32-bit
           ones in FIXUPP32 (new-format) records.

       (*) Added, tentatively, OS/2 object file support (as a minor variant
           on OBJ).

       (*) Updates to Fox Cutter's Borland C makefile, Makefile.bc2.

       (*) Removed a spurious second fclose() on the output file.

       (*) Added the `-s' command line option to redirect all messages
           which would go to stderr (errors, help text) to stdout instead.

       (*) Added the `-w' command line option to selectively suppress some
           classes of assembly warning messages.

       (*) Added the `-p' pre-include and `-d' pre-define command-line
           options.

       (*) Added an include file search path: the `-i' command line option.

       (*) Fixed a silly little preprocessor bug whereby starting a line
           with a `%!' environment-variable reference caused an `unknown
           directive' error.

       (*) Added the long-awaited listing file support: the `-l' command
           line option.

       (*) Fixed a problem with OBJ format whereby, in the absence of any
           explicit segment definition, non-global symbols declared in the
           implicit default segment generated spurious EXTDEF records in
           the output.

       (*) Added the NASM environment variable.

       (*) From this version forward, Win32 console-mode binaries will be
           included in the DOS distribution in addition to the 16-bit
           binaries. Added Makefile.vc for this purpose.

       (*) Added `return 0;' to test/objlink.c to prevent compiler
           warnings.

       (*) Added the __NASM_MAJOR__ and __NASM_MINOR__ standard defines.

       (*) Added an alternative memory-reference syntax in which prefixing
           an operand with `&' is equivalent to enclosing it in square
           brackets, at the request of Fox Cutter.

       (*) Errors in pass two now cause the program to return a non-zero
           error code, which they didn't before.

       (*) Fixed the single-line macro cycle detection, which didn't work
           at all on macros with no parameters (caused an infinite loop).
           Also changed the behaviour of single-line macro cycle detection
           to work like cpp, so that macros like `extrn' as given in the
           documentation can be implemented.

       (*) Fixed the implementation of WRT, which was too restrictive in
           that you couldn't do `mov ax,[di+abc wrt dgroup]' because
           (di+abc) wasn't a relocatable reference.

 C.4.4 Version 0.94 released April 1997

       (*) Major item: added the macro processor.

       (*) Added undocumented instructions SMI, IBTS, XBTS and LOADALL286.
           Also reorganised CMPXCHG instruction into early-486 and Pentium
           forms. Thanks to Thobias Jones for the information.

       (*) Fixed two more stupid bugs in ELF, which were causing `ld' to
           continue to seg-fault in a lot of non-trivial cases.

       (*) Fixed a seg-fault in the label manager.

       (*) Stopped FBLD and FBSTP from _requiring_ the TWORD keyword, which
           is the only option for BCD loads/stores in any case.

       (*) Ensured FLDCW, FSTCW and FSTSW can cope with the WORD keyword,
           if anyone bothers to provide it. Previously they complained
           unless no keyword at all was present.

       (*) Some forms of FDIV/FDIVR and FSUB/FSUBR were still inverted: a
           vestige of a bug that I thought had been fixed in 0.92. This was
           fixed, hopefully for good this time...

       (*) Another minor phase error (insofar as a phase error can _ever_
           be minor) fixed, this one occurring in code of the form

         rol ax,forward_reference 
         forward_reference equ 1

       (*) The number supplied to TIMES is now sanity-checked for
           positivity, and also may be greater than 64K (which previously
           didn't work on 16-bit systems).

       (*) Added Watcom C makefiles, and misc/pmw.bat, donated by Dominik
           Behr.

       (*) Added the INCBIN pseudo-opcode.

       (*) Due to the advent of the preprocessor, the [INCLUDE] and [INC]
           directives have become obsolete. They are still supported in
           this version, with a warning, but won't be in the next.

       (*) Fixed a bug in OBJ format, which caused incorrect object records
           to be output when absolute labels were made global.

       (*) Updates to RDOFF subdirectory, and changes to outrdf.c.

 C.4.5 Version 0.93 released January 1997

       This release went out in a great hurry after semi-crippling bugs
       were found in 0.92.

       (*) Really _did_ fix the stack overflows this time. *blush*

       (*) Had problems with EA instruction sizes changing between passes,
           when an offset contained a forward reference and so 4 bytes were
           allocated for the offset in pass one; by pass two the symbol had
           been defined and happened to be a small absolute value, so only
           1 byte got allocated, causing instruction size mismatch between
           passes and hence incorrect address calculations. Fixed.

       (*) Stupid bug in the revised ELF section generation fixed
           (associated string-table section for .symtab was hard-coded as
           7, even when this didn't fit with the real section table). Was
           causing `ld' to seg-fault under Linux.

       (*) Included a new Borland C makefile, Makefile.bc2, donated by Fox
           Cutter <lmb@comtch.iea.com>.

 C.4.6 Version 0.92 released January 1997

       (*) The FDIVP/FDIVRP and FSUBP/FSUBRP pairs had been inverted: this
           was fixed. This also affected the LCC driver.

       (*) Fixed a bug regarding 32-bit effective addresses of the form
           `[other_register+ESP]'.

       (*) Documentary changes, notably documentation of the fact that
           Borland Win32 compilers use `obj' rather than `win32' object
           format.

       (*) Fixed the COMENT record in OBJ files, which was formatted
           incorrectly.

       (*) Fixed a bug causing segfaults in large RDF files.

       (*) OBJ format now strips initial periods from segment and group
           definitions, in order to avoid complications with the local
           label syntax.

       (*) Fixed a bug in disassembling far calls and jumps in NDISASM.

       (*) Added support for user-defined sections in COFF and ELF files.

       (*) Compiled the DOS binaries with a sensible amount of stack, to
           prevent stack overflows on any arithmetic expression containing
           parentheses.

       (*) Fixed a bug in handling of files that do not terminate in a
           newline.

 C.4.7 Version 0.91 released November 1996

       (*) Loads of bug fixes.

       (*) Support for RDF added.

       (*) Support for DBG debugging format added.

       (*) Support for 32-bit extensions to Microsoft OBJ format added.

       (*) Revised for Borland C: some variable names changed, makefile
           added.

       (*) LCC support revised to actually work.

       (*) JMP/CALL NEAR/FAR notation added.

       (*) `a16', `o16', `a32' and `o32' prefixes added.

       (*) Range checking on short jumps implemented.

       (*) MMX instruction support added.

       (*) Negative floating point constant support added.

       (*) Memory handling improved to bypass 64K barrier under DOS.

       (*) `$' prefix to force treatment of reserved words as identifiers
           added.

       (*) Default-size mechanism for object formats added.

       (*) Compile-time configurability added.

       (*) `#', `@', `~' and c{?} are now valid characters in labels.

       (*) `-e' and `-k' options in NDISASM added.

 C.4.8 Version 0.90 released October 1996

       First release version. First support for object file output. Other
       changes from previous version (0.3x) too numerous to document.

Appendix D: Building NASM from Source
-------------------------------------

       The source code for NASM is available from our website,
       `https://www.nasm.us/', see section E.1.

   D.1 Building from a Source Archive

       The source archives available on the web site should be capable of
       building on a number of platforms. This is the recommended method
       for building NASM to support platforms for which executables are not
       available, if you do not require changing the source code.

       The preferred build platforms are development environments which
       support POSIX (Unix)-style tools (a "POSIX environment"). For
       Windows, MSYS2 (`https://www.msys2.org/') is such a development
       environment. Normally either `gcc' or `clang' is used as the
       compiler, but it is also possible to use MSVC with a POSIX wrapper
       like `cccl' from the SWIG project.

       In a POSIX environment, run:

            sh configure 
            make

       A number of options can be passed to `configure'; see
       `sh configure --help'. In particular, the `--host' option can be
       used to cross-compile NASM to run on another host system.

       For non-POSIX environments, a set of makefiles for a handful of
       other environments are also available; please see the file
       `Mkfiles/README'. These makefiles are generally considered
       unreliable, as we have very little ability to test them.

       The `.zip' version of the source archive has DOS/Windows line
       endings (`CR LF'), which many Unix/POSIX systems will not recognize.
       To extract the `.zip' version on such a system, use `unzip -a'. The
       `.tar' versions of the source archive has POSIX line endings (`LF').

   D.2 Optional Build Tools

       The following additional tools are required to build specific
       subsystems, to build from the `git' repository, or if the sources
       are modified.

       Note that some of these tools will have their own dependencies.

       Make sure all tools are available in your `PATH' (or equivalent.)

       To build the installer for the Windows platform:

       (*) The Nullsoft Scriptable Installer (NSIS,
           `https://nsis-dev.github.io/').

       To modify the sources, _or_ to build the documentation:

       (*) A Perl interpreter (`https://www.perl.org/').

       (*) Modules from CPAN (`https://www.cpan.org/'). The following Perl
           modules are currently required, some of which will be bundled
           with the Perl interpreter or into larger CPAN packages:

            Compress::Zlib 
            Fcntl 
            File::Basename 
            File::Compare 
            File::Copy 
            File::Find 
            File::Path 
            File::Spec 
            File::Temp 
            Font::TTF::Cmap 
            Font::TTF::Font 
            Font::TTF::Head 
            Font::TTF::Hmtx 
            Font::TTF::Maxp 
            Font::TTF::Post 
            Font::TTF::PSNames 
            Getopt::Long 
            JSON 
            Pod::Usage 
            Sort::Versions 
            Win32 (if building on Windows only)

       To build the documentation:

       (*) Either Ghostscript (`https://www.ghostscript.com/') or Adobe
           Acrobat Distiller (untested.)

       (*) The Google _Roboto_ and _Roboto Mono_ fonts, which are freely
           available under the SIL Open Font License
           (`https://github.com/google/roboto').

       To build the Unix man pages:

       (*) AsciiDoc (`https://asciidoc.org/').

       (*) xmlto (`https://pagure.io/xmlto/').

       To build from the `git' repository on a POSIX platform:

       (*) GNU `m4', `autoconf' and `autoheader' (`https://www.gnu.org/').

   D.3 Building Optional Components

       Install the required tools for the subsystem in question as
       described in section D.2.

       To build the documentation:

            make doc

       Building the documentation may not work in a non-POSIX environment.

       To build the Windows installer:

            make nsis

       To build the Unix man pages:

            make manpages

       To build everything available on the current platform:

            make everything

   D.4 Building from the `git' Repository

       The NASM development tree is kept in a source code repository using
       the `git' distributed source control system. The link is available
       on the website. This is recommended only to participate in the
       development of NASM or to assist with testing the development code.

       Install the required tools as described in section section D.2.

       In a POSIX environment:

       Run:

            sh autogen.sh

       to create the `configure' script and then build as described in
       section D.1.

       In a non-POSIX environment, use the tool-specific Makefiles as
       described in section D.1.

   D.5 Modifying the Sources

       To build modified sources, you will need the tools described in
       section D.2.

       Some build system changes might not be possible without a POSIX
       environment.

       If you have modified the sources to change the embedded declarations
       of warning classes, you may have to manually re-build the warning
       catalog:

            make warnings

       This is not done automatically, as the tools do not have the ability
       to automatically detect when it is necessary to do so.

Appendix E: Contact Information
-------------------------------

   E.1 Website

       NASM has a website at `https://www.nasm.us/'.

       New releases, release candidates, and daily development snapshots of
       NASM are available from the official web site in source form as well
       as binaries for a number of common platforms.

 E.1.1 User Forums

       Users of NASM may find the Forums on the website useful. These are,
       however, not frequented much by the developers of NASM, so they are
       not suitable for reporting bugs.

 E.1.2 Development Community

       The development of NASM is coordinated primarily though the
       `nasm-devel' mailing list. If you wish to participate in development
       of NASM, please join this mailing list. Subscription links and
       archives of past posts are available on the website.

   E.2 Reporting Bugs

       To report bugs in NASM, please use the bug tracker at
       `https://www.nasm.us/' (click on "Bug Tracker"), or if that fails
       then through one of the contacts in section E.1.

       Please read section 2.2 first, and don't report the bug if it's
       listed in there as a deliberate feature. (If you think the feature
       is badly thought out, feel free to send us reasons why you think it
       should be changed, but don't just send us mail saying `This is a
       bug' if the documentation says we did it on purpose.) Then read
       section 14.1, and don't bother reporting the bug if it's listed
       there.

       If you do report a bug, _please_ make sure your bug report includes
       the following information:

       (*) What operating system you're running NASM under: Linux, FreeBSD,
           NetBSD, MacOS X, Win16, Win32, Win64, MS-DOS, OS/2, VMS,
           whatever.

       (*) If you compiled your own executable from a source archive,
           compiled your own executable from `git', used the standard
           distribution binaries from the website, or got an executable
           from somewhere else (e.g. a Linux distribution.) If you were
           using a locally built executable, try to reproduce the problem
           using one of the standard binaries, as this will make it easier
           for us to reproduce your problem prior to fixing it.

       (*) Which version of NASM you're using, and exactly how you invoked
           it. Give us the precise command line, and the contents of the
           `NASMENV' environment variable if any.

       (*) Which versions of any supplementary programs you're using, and
           how you invoked them. If the problem only becomes visible at
           link time, tell us what linker you're using, what version of it
           you've got, and the exact linker command line. If the problem
           involves linking against object files generated by a compiler,
           tell us what compiler, what version, and what command line or
           options you used. (If you're compiling in an IDE, please try to
           reproduce the problem with the command-line version of the
           compiler.)

       (*) If at all possible, send us a NASM source file which exhibits
           the problem. If this causes copyright problems (e.g. you can
           only reproduce the bug in restricted-distribution code) then
           bear in mind the following two points: firstly, we guarantee
           that any source code sent to us for the purposes of debugging
           NASM will be used _only_ for the purposes of debugging NASM, and
           that we will delete all our copies of it as soon as we have
           found and fixed the bug or bugs in question; and secondly, we
           would prefer _not_ to be mailed large chunks of code anyway. The
           smaller the file, the better. A three-line sample file that does
           nothing useful _except_ demonstrate the problem is much easier
           to work with than a fully fledged ten-thousand-line program. (Of
           course, some errors _do_ only crop up in large files, so this
           may not be possible.)

       (*) A description of what the problem actually _is_. `It doesn't
           work' is _not_ a helpful description! Please describe exactly
           what is happening that shouldn't be, or what isn't happening
           that should. Examples might be: `NASM generates an error message
           saying Line 3 for an error that's actually on Line 5'; `NASM
           generates an error message that I believe it shouldn't be
           generating at all'; `NASM fails to generate an error message
           that I believe it _should_ be generating'; `the object file
           produced from this source code crashes my linker'; `the ninth
           byte of the output file is 66 and I think it should be 77
           instead'.

       (*) If you believe the output file from NASM to be faulty, send it
           to us. That allows us to determine whether our own copy of NASM
           generates the same file, or whether the problem is related to
           portability issues between our development platforms and yours.
           We can handle binary files mailed to us as MIME attachments,
           uuencoded, and even BinHex. Alternatively, we may be able to
           provide an FTP site you can upload the suspect files to; but
           mailing them is easier for us.

       (*) Any other information or data files that might be helpful. If,
           for example, the problem involves NASM failing to generate an
           object file while TASM can generate an equivalent file without
           trouble, then send us _both_ object files, so we can see what
           TASM is doing differently from us.

Appendix F: Instruction List
----------------------------

   F.1 Introduction

       The following sections show the instructions which NASM currently
       supports. For each instruction, there is a separate entry for each
       supported addressing mode. The third column shows the processor type
       in which the instruction was introduced and, when appropriate, one
